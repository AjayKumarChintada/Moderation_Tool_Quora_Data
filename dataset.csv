What are some famous places in Vrindavan?,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-famous-places-in-Vrindavan,,I’d suggest you don’t go to Vrindavan as a tourist but as a seeker. The land of Vrindavan has got the sweetness in every step - just look beyond the material clutter which present-day conditions have created. As for your question Shri Bankey Bihari Temple and Sri Sri Krishna Balarama Mandir (ISKCON - Vrindavan) are undoubtedly two of the most famous places. But apart from it here’s a list: Shri Radha Raman temple (self-manifested deity from almost 500 years back!) Shri Radha Madan-mohan temple (this is protected by the ASI) Shri Radha Damodar temple Shri Radha Shyamsundar temple Imlitala Keshi Ghat Nidhivan Chir Ghat Shri Rang ji temple Shahji temple Shri Radha Gopinath temple Gopeshwar Mahadev temple Vamsivat Shringarvat These are only few of the places you can go to in Vrindavan. If you look up Gaudiya Vaishnavism you’ll see the significance of few of the temples mentioned above. There’s a short movie set in Vrindavan called Reconnection. Would highly recommend watching it. It has won several awards and nominations worldwide. Here’s the link :,Radhika Sachdeva,https://www.quora.com/profile/Radhika-Sachdeva-2

Soul is also called marginal energy and is superior to material energy as said in Bhagavad Gita 7.5 apareyam itas tv anyamprakrtim viddhi me paramjiva-bhutam maha-bahoyayedam dharyate jagat Besides this inferior nature O mighty-armed Arjuna there is a superior energy of Mine which are all living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe. Roles Mind: Mind is master of all senses most notorious and very difficult to control. Arjuna said to Krishna Gita 6.34 cancalam hi manah krsnapramathi balavad drdhamtasyaham nigraham manyevayor iva su-duskaram For the mind is restless turbulent obstinate and very strong O Krsna and to subdue it is it seems to me more difficult than controlling the wind.

Intelligent men try to control mind by use of intelligence. Ego: Identity of a living entity. In material world identity is false. It is not identity of soul and hence not permanent. Soul: Spiritual spark and real identity of living entity. Please read other answers for properties of soul. Hope this clarifies Thanks,Nitesh Gupta,https://www.quora.com/profile/Nitesh-Gupta-9
According to the Bhagavad Gita who has more importance a person's parents or guests?,https://www.quora.com/According-to-the-Bhagavad-Gita-who-has-more-importance-a-persons-parents-or-guests,https://qsf.cf2.quoracdn.net/-4-images.new_grid.profile_default.png-26-688c79556f251aa0.png,According to Bhagavad gita KNOWLEDGE is the key to progress on both material and spiritual levels. Service to one's parents and to guests is mainly based on the fact that both your elders and saintly visiting sadhus can bless you with valuable knowledge. In Vedic culture and society elderly parents remained at home only if unable to fulfill the requirements of vanaprastha and sannyasa generally because of frail health but lived a retired life of austerity and meditation. Travelers who went to take shelter in the house of grihasthis were generally pilgrims or itinerant (parivrajaka) sadhus. Continue ReadingAccording to Bhagavad gita KNOWLEDGE is the key to progress on both material and spiritual levels. Service to one's parents and to guests is mainly based on the fact that both your elders and saintly visiting sadhus can bless you with valuable knowledge. In Vedic culture and society elderly parents remained at home only if unable to fulfill the requirements of vanaprastha and sannyasa generally because of frail health but lived a retired life of austerity and meditation. Travelers who went to take shelter in the house of grihasthis were generally pilgrims or itinerant (parivrajaka) sadhus. On the other hand wealthy tourists and merchants traveled in self sufficient caravans not unlike modern day campers. Of course if your biological parents or elders happen to be senile and degraded criminals who have no sense of ethics or morality any type of guest and even any other decent person will be more deserving of your service. Similarly if you happen to be visited by some arrogant and ignorant fool who wants to exploit your good will to easily get free accommodation and food without any trace of reciprocation you should certainly prefer to offer service to your own parents even if they are not exactly perfect people. Another aspect of the issue is that both one's parents and visiting guests are usually in need of assistance because they are not self sufficient for some reason. In that case if you need to choose you should give priority to those whose need is greater. But I don't see why you can't give service to both categories equally.,Parama Devi,https://www.quora.com/profile/Parama-Devi
