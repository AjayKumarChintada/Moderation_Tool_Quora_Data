I’d suggest you don’t go to Vrindavan as a tourist but as a seeker. The land of Vrindavan has got the sweetness in every step - just look beyond the material clutter which present-day conditions have created. As for your question Shri Bankey Bihari Temple and Sri Sri Krishna Balarama Mandir (ISKCON - Vrindavan) are undoubtedly two of the most famous places. But apart from it here’s a list: Shri Radha Raman temple (self-manifested deity from almost 500 years back!) Shri Radha Madan-mohan temple (this is protected by the ASI) Shri Radha Damodar temple Shri Radha Shyamsundar temple Imlitala Keshi Ghat Nidhivan Chir Ghat Shri Rang ji temple Shahji temple Shri Radha Gopinath temple Gopeshwar Mahadev temple Vamsivat Shringarvat These are only few of the places you can go to in Vrindavan. If you look up Gaudiya Vaishnavism you’ll see the significance of few of the temples mentioned above. There’s a short movie set in Vrindavan called Reconnection. Would highly recommend watching it. It has won several awards and nominations worldwide.
