This is one of the question that vexes society. In one sense I do not like non-Hindus to visit temples because their motive is not worship they come to gawk at what is exotic to them and take a flurry of pictures.  I was recently in Arunachala and there a group of women were lighting multiple lamps in a single plate and were doing aradhana at a shrine. Then comes along a white lady with her camera and start taking pictures the ladies got distracted and started posing for the camera to the end that the white women was directing them on how to stand to get the best light etc. And in the meantime bhava was lost. Who is to blame here? But then there is no guarantee that every Hindu who visits a temple has similar devotion. Nor is that all non-Hindus come to gawk as tourists. So it is a call the temples have to make there is no perfect solution to such.  In my opinion given my experience of Abrahamic religions where they think to pray to ""idols"" is bizarre and exotic. I rather fall on the other side of the line that they should not be allowed to visit the Shrines. A Hindu can visit a Church or a Mosque for a simple reason that a Hindu does not consider such a worship as pagan heathen or mushrik. The Hindu does not stand in judgement. But Abrahamics do stand in judgement upon other religions. I do not want to invite someone to my home knowing that their motives are thus. And I don't want my heritage to be gawked at or our practices - as though we are performing monkeys in a circus act. Sure there will be exceptions to this but it is near impossible to verify. So for now I think it is better policy to keep them away.  Be it USCIRF or people like Jeffery Kripal trusting them and giving them access has turned out to be a bad choice for us. For they end up demeaning what we value.  We should stop being suckers for the ""white person's opinion"" we are proud that they appreciate our art heritage etc. But every time this has lead to that particular art or custom being stripped of its dharmic moorings and marketed as a ""secularized"" exotic product and slowly appropriated. I know it is not intuitive for us to be suspicious. But it is better we learn from History.",Raghu Bhaskaran,https://www.quora.com/profile/Raghu-Bhaskaran

To me that number sounds low. Going by my personal experience I would guess a higher ratio of temples : Hindus. I suspect the real number of temples is larger and that a lot of small village and neighborhood temples without officially organized registered management did not get counted. I’m sure they didn’t miss any big temples like this:But did they really track down all the little remote rural temples like this?So the most accurate answer that can be given is more than two million. I would not be surprised if the real number is three or four million. Given this it feels rather unfair to pick a favorite. I have probably visited more than a hundred temples in India but less than three hundred. That feels like a lot but it’s nothing compared to the millions of temples out there many of which I’m sure are wonderful and probably surpassing any I’ve seen. So my favorite of the temples that I personally have been to is Badrinath Temple.,Devala Rees,https://www.quora.com/profile/Devala-Rees

What king or emperor was at Adishankara’s command that he could order the killing of Buddhists and destroy their monasteries? How could a lone mendicant travelling with not more than four disciples have brought that about? Moreover why would a compassionate being like Adishankara do so? As opposed to such views Shankara’s imminent task was chiefly to bring the diverse and inconsistent philosophical systems within Hindusim into the fold of Vedanta and not to fight those beyond the scope of Vedic religion. The challenges of his times were more internal than external. While it is true that he has refuted Buddhist tenets in his Brahmasutrabhashya where is the proof that he held debates with the Buddhists and worst of all ordered them to be killed? If at all Shankara did hold a debate with Buddhist scholars and defeated them those scholars would have followed Vedanta as this was the norm in those days. Buddhism in India was wiped out because of Islamic Invaders. Dr. BR Ambedkar in his work ‘The decline and fall of Buddhism’ has made this fact amply clear. He saysThere can be no doubt that the fall of Buddhism in India was due to the invasions of the Musalmans. Islam came out as the enemy of the 'But'. The word 'But' as everybody knows is the Arabic word and means an idol. Thus the origin of the word indicates that in the Moslem mind idol worship had come to be identified with the Religion of the Buddha. To the Muslims they were one and the same thing. The mission to break the idols thus became the mission to destroy Buddhism. Islam destroyed Buddhism not only in India but wherever it went. Before Islam came into being Buddhism was the religion of Bactria Parthia Afghanistan Gandhar and Chinese Turkestan as it was of the whole of Asia. . .The Mussalman invaders sacked the Buddhist universities of Nalanda Vikramshila Jagaddala Odantapuri to name only a few. They razed to the ground Buddhist monasteries with which the country was studded. The monks fled away in thousands to Nepal Tibet and other places outside India. A very large number were killed outright by the Muslim commanders. How the Buddhist priesthood perished by the sword of the Muslim invaders has been recorded by the Muslim historians themselves. Summarizing the evidence relating to the slaughter of the Buddhist Monks perpetrated by the Musalman General in the course of his invasion of Bihar in 1197 AD Mr. Vincent Smith says ""....Great quantities of plunder were obtained and the slaughter of the 'shaven headed Brahmans' that is to say the Buddhist monks was so thoroughly completed that when the victor sought for someone capable of explaining the contents of the books in the libraries of the monasteries not a living man could be found who was able to read them. 'It was discovered' we are told 'that the whole of that fortress and city was a college and in the Hindi tongue they call a college Bihar.' ""Such was the slaughter of the Buddhist priesthood perpetrated by the Islamic invaders. The axe was struck at the very root. For by killing the Buddhist priesthood Islam killed Buddhism. This was the greatest disaster that befell the religion of the Buddha in India..Scholars and authors like KS Lal Koenrad Elst Sita Ram Goel and others have made it clear that Islam was the reason why Buddhism was wiped out not only in India but from the entire Asian region between Iran and Malaysia. The fact is that it has not stopped yet as is evidenced by the Taliban blasting of Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan.Also as Prof Elst cites in his writings as late as 2002 there have been incidents in Kargil to convert Buddhists into Islam. It's continuing and there have been clashes between the Buddhists of Ladakh and the Muslims of Kashmir.[1] The propaganda that Adishankara ‘ordered’ the killing of Buddhists and destroying of their monasteries is a ridiculous heinous myth. It is a clever misdirection to discredit Hindus for the acts of someone else.Footnotes[1] Ladakh tense over Muslim-Buddhist ‘love jihad’ marriage - Times of India",Kratu Nandan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Kratu-Nandan

Mon Jun 12 2017 The creator of existence and the father behind all happenings has a miraculous story associated with his introduction to the world. His presence can still be felt if you go to Lord Jagannath Temple of Puri with all the devotion and dedication. Jagannath Temple of Puri is said to be one among the 4 most sacred places in the world. Before you head towards the real abode of God understand the real story behind his presence. This will for sure take your soul closer to the Lord and help you attain eternal bliss. The wish of King Indradyumna The devotion of the great King made him feel the power which has no boundaries – the power of Lord Jagannath! King Indradyumna was a great devotee of Lord Vishnu and was eager to meet him face to face. Once a brahmana came to the palace of the King Indrayumna and told him about an incarnation of Lord Vishnu named Nila Madhava. The king then sent different brahmana’s out to search for Lord Nila Madhava. They all returned unsuccessful except a priest named Vidyapati. The discovery by Vidyapati After traveling for a while Vidyapati came to an area inhabited by non-Aryans called sabaras. He stayed at the house of a local chief called Visvavasu. When he arrived Visvavasu was not there but his daughter Lalita was. Vidyapati stayed there for some time and eventually married Lalita the daughter of the Sabara. Vidyapati noticed some peculiar behavior of his host. Visvavasu would go out every day around noon and would return back to the house scented with fragrances of sandalwood camphor and musk. Vidyapati asked his wife about this and she informed him that his father would go daily to worship Nila Madhava. Lalita had been told by her father not to tell anyone about Nila Madhava but she had overstepped that order by telling her husband. Vidyapati repeatedly requested to see Nila Madhava. The sight of Nila Madhava Finally Visvavasu bound Vidyapati’s eyes and took him to see Nila Madhava. Vidyapati secretly carried some mustard seeds in his cloth and he dropped them onto the path as he was walking. When he reached Nila Madhava the blindfold was removed and Vidyapati saw Nila Madhava. Visvavasu went out to collect some forest flowers to worship and Vidyapati stayed near the Deity. During this time a crow fell off the branch of a tree into a nearby lake and drowned. It immediately took a four armed Vaikuntha form and started back to the spiritual world. Vidyapati then climbed up onto the tree and was about to jump into the lake. A voice came from the sky and said: ""Since you have seen Nila Madhava you should inform King Indradyumna."" The hurting wish of Lord Vishnu Visvavasu returned and started his daily worship of Nila Madhava. Suddenly the Lord spoke to him and said ""I have accepted for many days the simple forest flowers and roots offered to me by you. Now I desire the royal worship offered to me in devotion by King Indradyumna."" Visvavasu felt cheated by his son-in-law; therefore he bound him up and kept in his house. After repeatedly being requested by his daughter he let him go. The brahmana then went to King Indradyumna and told him about his discovery. By following the mustard seeds which had grown into small plants they were able to follow the path to Nila Madhava. When they reached the spot they could not find him. King Indradyumna had the village besieged and arrested Visvavasu. Suddenly a voice came from the sky “Release this sabara. On top of Nila hill you should construct a temple. There I will manifest as Daru-brahman (the Absolute Truth manifested in a wooden form). You will not see me as Nila Madhava.",Pratik Awsarmol,https://www.quora.com/profile/Pratik-Awsarmol

I believe that you can understand what i mean to say.. Thank you.. Jai swaminarayan,Nishant Parekh,https://www.quora.com/profile/Nishant-Parekh-18

Among the two Adhi Shesha and Garuda who is more powerful?,https://www.quora.com/Among-the-two-Adhi-Shesha-and-Garuda-who-is-more-powerful,https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-210a95500ae3392be50f4e22e1b42a3c.webp | https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6dcbd998a3a0d203bffee3b419dcdd65.webp | https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d4a58f9b70c965e4a6986385e515f2da-pjlq,WOW! A2A on this! Thanks a LOT! Let’s jump into this well-posed question straightaway and compare these two celebrated mythological creatures in Hinduism: ADI-SHESH or SHESHNAG (THE SERPENT IMAGERY IN RELIGIONS): In Hinduism Adi Shesha or Sheshnag is the primordial multi-headed king of serpents associated with the creation/destruction of the universe. The coiling of this great snake leads to creation as time moves forward; when it coils back the universe ceases to exist. In Sanskrit the word Shesh means “remainder”. The time between the destruction of a universe and the creation of a new universe is called Kalpa. Thus this serpent is all that remains when a universe ceases to exist! This great snake forms the resting bed for Mahavishnu the preserver God as he lies on the sea of universes or the Kshir Samudra. It is believed that new universes are created destroyed and merged infinitely like countless bubbles in this cosmic ocean! To elaborate this is how the serpent is described in Hindu religious texts:The serpent is entrusted with the responsibility of giving the gift of time to a baby universe as soon as it is created. Additionally the serpent was granted a boon by the Creator God Brahma to bear the weight of the Earth.Similar to this we have the Norse myth of Jörmungandr or the Midguard Serpent who bears the Earth and ensures stability by grasping its own tail. When the serpent releases its tail the Nordic equivalent destruction begins (Ragnarök). Adhi Shesh is therefore a symbolic manifestation of the perennial nature of time. The snake symbolises the tender equilibrium between the simultaneous creation and destruction of universes. GARUDA (THE ANTHROPOMORPHIC EAGLE): Garuda is a half-human half eagle divine creature (sometimes seen as a God) that is the mount or Vahana of Lord Vishnu. Legend has it that Garuda was so humongous a creature that when it flew it would block the Sun’s rays. Garuda who is the King of the Birds feasts exclusively on snakes and is therefore the sworn enemy of the serpents or the Nāgas.Legend has it that Garuda had six sons from whom the entire race of birds evolved. Various stories are there in Hindu mythology that celebrate the laurels of this majestic being the most famous of them being how Garuda brings amrita the elixir of immortality of the Gods from the Heavens to the Earth. The Garuda imagery commonly arises in Buddhist and other South-Asian cultures as well evolving out of Hinduism and expanding globally. Garuda is said to wear the great snake Adi-Shesha when he flies but this is NOT proof that Garuda is more powerful out of those two! Garuda wears the great snake as a promise he made to the serpents for which have a look at my answer to: If Garuda and Nagas are enemies why does he hold some of them like Vaasuki on his body? THE CONCLUSION: Garuda is credited with other heroic laurels but none for me even comes close remotely to the act of conserving creating and destroying universes and connecting these infinite universes as a single fabric of time a task the Gods entrusted to Adi-Shesha. I would hence go on to claim that the Great Snake (Adi-Shesha) is much more potent and powerful than the Great Eagle (Garuda)!!!Upvote if you liked my answer! I had to do some rigorous research before writing this but it was TOTALLY WORTH IT!!! Follow me on Quora for more answers. Comments are welcomed.

Any box although looks like a post box but isn't authorised by the postal services can't help us our letters to reach the destination. It's fake.

It is beyond physical reality therefore it will become that the way you want to see it. 1. One must remember that all actions that he/she performs are entirely done by the ’Cause and Effect’ of nature. He/unnecessarily takes the claim upon him. Therefore dedicating all actions on Ishvara(Lord) will make you free from lust greed and anger. “All action is entirely done by the Gunas (qualities) of Prakriti(nature). Man deluded by the sense of ‘I’ thinks ‘I am the doer’.”—Bhagavad Gita Chapter3 ShContinue ReadingI think Bhagavad Gita is the highest spiritual revelation by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

One must remember that all actions that he/she performs are entirely done by the ’Cause and Effect’ of nature. He/unnecessarily takes the claim upon him. Therefore dedicating all actions on Ishvara(Lord) will make you free from lust greed and anger. “All action is entirely done by the Gunas (qualities) of Prakriti(nature). Man deluded by the sense of ‘I’ thinks ‘I am the doer’.”—Bhagavad Gita Chapter3 Shloka 27 2. One should remember that it is action (Karma) that creates everything. Therefore without being lazy one must perform it’s allotted task with an undivided mind. “Do your allotted task; for action is superior to inaction; with inaction even life’s normal course is not possible’’ —Bhagavad Gita. Chapter3 Shloka 8 3. Inner Discipline makes you strong. One should not sway with his roaming senses and eat whatever his tongue tastes good sleep whenever his desires force him and reproduce impelled by lust. One must act wisely with these things so that he will remain unaffected by tragedies. “To him who is disciplined in food and recreation in effort in all activities and in sleep and waking Yoga (Discipline) becomes a relief from all ills.”—Bhagavad Gita Chapter6 Shloka 17 4. Always have faith in Ishvara(Supreme personality). Ishvara(Lord) dwells in faith. You can not live without faith whether your faith is that you don’t have faith in Ishvara(Lord) still Ishvara(Supreme Personality of Godhead) shall be with you in the way you desire. Surrendering to Ishvara(Lord) shall give you strength in performing your Karma. “ Whatever form one desires to worship in faith and devotion in that very form I make that faith of his secure’—Bhagavad Gita Chapter7 Shloka 21 5. One should try to consume the food that comes from plant sources. Plants are the ones who have the strength to consume the energy from the sun. Like a Yogi they are constant and consuming their energy shall nourish your mind with the strength of Ishvara( Lord). Avoid hurting all innocent animals. “Victuals that add to one’s years vitality strength health happiness and appetite; are savory rich substantial and inviting are dear to sattvika”—Bhagavad Gita Chapter 17 Shloka 8 6. When your life becomes a burden on you do not give up. This is the time for the ‘Mahabharata war’. Forget that this life is yours. Fight against all sorrows stress and pain it sends against you. If you overcome(slay) all those pain sufferings and misery in your life you shall attain success (Earth/a position you want/ material success). But in case you get failed you will have no regret but you shall feel the heavenly joy as you had fought without desiring anything. “O Kaunteya! Slain you shall gain heaven; victorious you shall inherit the earth: therefore arise determined to fight”—Bhagavad Gita Chapter2 Shloka 37 7. Most often your taste smell feelings and all sensual activities will try to drive you away from your goal. Remember that it’s the Maya(illusion). Therefore it is wise to not to come under the roaming senses. “For when his mind runs after any of the roaming senses it sweeps away his understanding as the wind a vessel upon the water”—Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2 Shloka 67 8. You have not seen the future. Even you do not know what will happen after a while. But you always are worried about it. Remember action is only in your hand and the fruit(result) of the action is not. For each action there is a result therefore why to think about results? It will certainly take some efforts and your efforts will be divided. You will not be able to perform a task with complete devotion. Hence perform your Karma without desiring the fruit as each action has a fruit. “Action alone is thy province never the fruits thereof; let not your motive be the fruit of action nor should you desire to avoid action”— Bhagavad Gita Chapter2 Shloka 47 9. You might read all the books gain all the knowledge. You might practice all the skills but they shall not bring peace. The only thing that can bring peace is the renunciation of the fruit of all actions. Don’t be worried about thinking what will happen but live in the moment of your present. Why be worried about something that has no existence? “Better is Knowledge than practice better than knowledge is concentration better than concentration is the renunciation of the fruit of all actions(Karma) from which directly issues peace”—Bhagavad Gita Chapter 12 Shloka 12 10.All the things that you consider Knowledge is nothing but the manifestations of the self. Therefore the only knowledge that you should try to gain is the knowledge of the self(Atman). “There is nothing in this world so purifying as knowledge(Self). He who is perfected by Yoga finds it in himself in the fullness of time’’—Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4 Shloka 38,Biswajit Mohanty,https://www.quora.com/profile/Biswajit-Mohanty-74

Once the lord killed the demon still Narashima was in uncontrollable anger which even any other gods or asuras feared to go near to him. Even lord shiva tried to his ultimate power to control narashima but Bhaktha praglathan was not harmed instead blessed by Narashima. It was very clear that Bhaktha Pragalathan had done what other gods cant do.2. In hinduism there are plenty of asuras and devas tried to get boon to be im-mortal. Even great asuras like hirinyakashibu ravana was unable to get the boon even after performing years of thava. But our beloved bhakth Markendaya got the boon to be immortal from lord shiva. Markendaya got what no other powerful asuras tried to get.In hinduism Gods are not powerful because each God treats their bhakts more than them. Hinduism is such a beautiful religion. They will do anything for bhakths. According to me lord shiva respects workships Lord vishnu and vice versa. So lord shiva tries to make lord vishnu win and lord vishnu will try to make shiva win. Whoever wins the credit goes to opposite. So both of them will never loose if they had a fight.,Satheesh,https://www.quora.com/profile/Satheesh-108

I thought a lot and I discovered a very interesting and practical view point to this Nar-Narayan incarnation. Lord Krishna is the incarnation of Narayan which is The Supreme Personality Parabrahma Parmatma. The One who is present in each and every living/non-living entity as a Soul an Aatma. Arjun is the incarnation of Nar which is a human like you and me. A human who can achieve greatest of victories and glories by having ultimate faith in Parmatma sitting inside him as a soul.

I thought a lot and I discovered a very interesting and practical view point to this Nar-Narayan incarnation. Lord Krishna is the incarnation of Narayan which is The Supreme Personality Parabrahma Parmatma. The One who is present in each and every living/non-living entity as a Soul an Aatma. Arjun is the incarnation of Nar which is a human like you and me. A human who can achieve greatest of victories and glories by having ultimate faith in Parmatma sitting inside him as a soul. Now let's see some events of Mahabharat:Arjun alone had to fight with deamons while burning Khandav Van to convert it into Indraprasth. Lord Krishna was alongside him at that battle but didn't fight for him.Arjun alone had to aim and shot the fish's eye to marry Draupadi in swayamvar. Lord Krishna was alongside him at that swayamvar but didn't shot an arrow for him.Arjun alone had to survive and struggle the 12 years of exile and 1 year of agyaatvaas. Lord Krishna was constantly by his side but didn't took the struggle and pain of him in those 13 years.Arjun alone had to fought the whole Mahabharat to regain his Indraprasth. Lord Krishna was alongside him throughout the battle but didn't touched a weapon during the entire Mahabharat.What's the lesson in this? “Even if you have Bhagwan (The Only One) by your side you have to perform your Karma your duities to make every single event happen. Bhagwan will not do the required Karma for that event to happen. You will have to do.” Arjun had to perform his Karma in every situation. Lord Krishna guided him in every step but it was Arjun who had to move his hands and feets in the end to make everything happen. Lord Krishna always guides you and me and everyone sitting as an Aatma inside us. Some call it intuition some call it inner voice. But eventually it's us who should become Arjun and must belive and have faith in that inner voice and perform our required efforts to make things happen.

Today is March 4 2019 and we are celebrating Mahashivratri festival in India. I still am overwhelmed with the incident took place today noon which I am sharing with you all. Since my earliest memories on the special days like Shravan month Mondays and Mahashivratri I used to go and worship Gopeshwar Mahadev Temple which is situated at the Town Hall of Indore and only 500 meters from my residence.Temple timings for offering abhishekam to the Shivling is from 5 am till 12 in the noon. This 12 means 12 sharp! The main priest closes the doors exactly at 12 even if Prime Minister wants to perform abhishekam. My father and grandfather too are witness to this 12 pm closing rule. And even on Mahashivratri temple closes exactly at 12. I have seen throughout my life. So coming to the main point I desperately wanted to go and perform abhishekam being Mahashivratri today. But today morning was very weird for me and I got stuck up in some unavoidable and important work. 11 am crossed 11:30 am crossed and finally when I saw the clock it was showing 12:05 pm. My heart dropped and I lost all the hopes of going to the temple. Performed abhishek at home and continuously persuading my heart like that it's ok and we will go to the temple tomorrow and Shiv Ji is residing in your heart always so don't be sad and so on. And situationally at around 1:15 pm I had to visit the doctor whose two clinics are on either side from my residence. My brother insisted that we should go to his newly opened clinic. Surprisingly doctor's new clinic was on the same road where Gopeshwar Temple is situated. So we both started from home and passed by the temple. And when I offered my pranam from outside I saw 10–12 devotees going inside and performing abhishekam. I couldn't believed my eyes what I saw. I checked the watch and it was showing 1:20 pm! I parked my vehicle and we both ran towards the temple. There I saw main gate of the garbhagrih open and devotees are pouring milk/water on Shivling! That was the strangest part as why the temple not closed at 1:30 pm! But Shiv Ji is way beyond all the whys and hows! I believe it is the will of Shiv Ji to grant me darshan and abhishekam. My eyes slightly wet I washed my hands and feet entered into the garbhagrih and performed abhishekam to my heart's content.Offered my pranam many times and then resumed journey to the doctor's clinic. Things like these whenever happened with me I feel he is standing right beside me holding my hand and he will take me to his place after my role is done here.

Was Rudra mentioned in the Vedas the same god as Shiva mentioned in the Puranas?,https://www.quora.com/Was-Rudra-mentioned-in-the-Vedas-the-same-god-as-Shiva-mentioned-in-the-Puranas,https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b076e70ccb2692feb6f619ebf706ecd8,Openly from the deeper practical spiritual point of view any Puranic characteristic of any gods mentioned in Vedas cannot be the same as Vedic one. The main reason is that the Vedic time was not a religious time (as we know the religion nowadays) and Puranic time was already typically religious time. It follows that the terms devotion belief and worship naturally have different meaning in Vedic and Puranic times. In the Vedic time the devotion belief and worship had actually scientific character (realistic in relation to daily life - practical experiential wisdom) while the devotion belief and worship in Puranic time had already religious character (not realistic in relation to daily life – devotional religious knowledge). Thus even there could be a traditional view that Shiva is the same as Rudra it does not mean that both (Vedic and Puranic) interpretations of Rudra and Shiva are the same. To answer the question: Rudra mentioned in Vedas is not the same as Shiva mentioned in Puranas. Despite of this fact the Puranic interpretations and attitudes towards Shiva can have connotations with interpretations of Rudra.,Stefan Pecho,https://www.quora.com/profile/Stefan-Pecho

Fire plays a role in cremations the worship of important deities through sacrifices and offerings and in daily Hindu routines. Not only Hinduism maintenance of a dhuni is important in several traditions including Zoroastrianism Buddism Jainism and Sufism. At Sai Baba's first advent to Shirdi he said some people of Shirdi to dig beneath the Neem Tree and there they found 4 miraculously burning lamps buried underneath along-with a Rudraksha Mala. Baba regarded these 4 burning earthen lamps each symbolic for Satya Dharm Peace & Love respectively. Baba said that his Guru used to perform penance at this same place. Hence the name of this place is “Gurusthan”. Baba then said that the time for the 4 lamps to continue burning in Gurusthan was now over and that they should be shifted from the Gurusthan to ""Dwarkamai"" his Karmsthan where they would continue to burn as his ""DHUNI"" till the time this World exists.

Many folklore exists which speculate about a Platonic relationship between the two.  I had read a novel by Rajshekhar Basu written at least 50 years ago named Panchajanya. The novel is based on Mahabharata and offers interpretations of many  of the events of the Mahabharata from a different perspective than what is more popular. The relationship between Karna and Draupadi is one of the most interesting sub-plot of the novel Karna is the quintessential tragic hero. All throughout his life he had suffered rejection. He was abandoned as a baby by his mother he was rejected by Dronacharya he was rejected by Draupadi and was denied the most coveted throne in the world although he was the rightful heir to it.   Now regarding the relationship between Draupadi and Karna it began with the sayamvar arranged during Draupadi's marriage. (For those who do not know a Sayamvar is a competition held among those men who are seeking to marry one girl of course the winner gets the chick.) There was no pre-condition given in the Sayamvar and everyone was allowed to participate and theoretically any one could win. However it was actually not so. Draupadi was the daughter of King Dhrupad who was defeated in a war by Dronacharya with the help of Arjuna. To rub salt to his wounds Drona also took half of his kingdom to humiliate him. Dhrupad had since nurtured a deep grudge against Drona and wanted revenge. He arranged for a Yajna (Its an elaborate prayer) and asked from God to give him something or someone who can defeat Drona and bring back his honor. From the holy fire of the Yajna emerged this stunningly beautiful girl who was named Krishnaa (not to be confused with Sri Krishna.)  and a boy named Dhristadyumna. The Gods told Dhrupad that these two siblings will avenge his humiliation and asked him to raise them as his own children. Dhristadyumna will later play his part and kill Drona in the battle of Kurukshetra but Krishnaa's role was much more subtle. She knowingly and unknowingly played out her destiny. She would later go on to become the main reason for the great war between the Pandavas and the Kauravas. It is as if her life was pre-programmed.  This girl was also named Draupadi.  However Dhrupad soon realized that as long as Arjuna was with Drona it was not possible for anyone on Earth or Heaven to do anything to him. So he was elated when the Pandavas fell out with the Kauravas and were castigated from their Kingdom. He knew that Drona had remained on the side of the Kauravas and hatched a plan to get his revenge. He thought that if he could make a permanent alliance with Arjuna he can possibly have his revenge on Drona through him. So he arranged for this elaborate Sayamvar for Draupadi's marriage but the task he set for the competitors was so ridiculously difficult he was sure that no one else other than Arjuna would succeed. As the Pandavas at that time were in hiding living as poor Brahmins he kept the competition open for all with no restriction on age caste or creed.    What the story about Draupadi's birth tells us is that Draupadi was a woman on mission. She had to marry Arjuna as that was the way she could play out the role for which she was born. So when in the Sayamvar this unknown prince named Karna was about to complete the task which was supposed to be un-achievable to everyone except Arjuna she panicked.  I think it is time to mention what the task was. The task which all the competitors were suppose to try was to take the bow and arrow which were kept in the arena tie the string of the bow and shoot an arrow through the eye of a fish hanging from the ceiling. The archer was not supposed to look at the fish directly he was to do this task by just looking at the shadow of the fish on water kept in a tank. It is something like the picture below but the fish was actually kept at a farther distance than shown here. Anyway now the funny thing was that all the great Kings and Princes of the country failed to even tie the string to the bow because it was very heavy. But when Karna tried to do it he had no problem in tying the string and was about to shoot the effing eye off the fish! It was at this point Draupadi realized that this guy was going to nail it and the guy was none of the Pandavas. She had to stop it with an excuse and she chose to deride Karna for his caste. Karna's foster parents were Sut which is one of the so called ""lower castes"". Draupadi had nothing personal against Karna and she was not prejudiced against his caste it was just an excuse thought of in a haste. She wanted to marry only Arjuna as she believed that he was the only one who could help her accomplish her destiny.  But this public refusal was a great humiliation for Karna as all those who were present in the Sayamvar laughed and taunted him all those people who were no match for Karna in terms of strength and skills. But Karna the gentleman he is did not say anything offensive and politely bowed out of the competition. Draupadi felt terrible for doing what she did and noticed how handsome and a perfect gentleman Karna was. It was this incident which created a soft spot in Draupadi's heart for Karna. Obviously Arjuna completed the task with no problem and married the beautiful Draupadi. The next time the two came face to face was during the whole Vastraharan fiasco. For those who are not familiar the story is that the Pandavas had lost all they had in a gambling match with the Kauravas and after they had given up everything they even pawned their wife Draupadi and unsurprisingly lost. As a result the Kauravas who were not reputed to be very respectful of women tried to strip Draupadi in public.  The Pandavas had already pawned themselves in the game and had lost it so they were already slaves of the Kauravas and so was bound by some kind of shitty law of those times which said that they could not harm their masters no matter what they did. So the Kauravas decided to take the opportunity to humiliate Draupadi in the most crudest of ways. Karna who was a friend of the Kauravas was present in the court when this barbaric act was taking place. Draupadi recognized Karna and asked him for help. But Karna instead of helping Draupadi stood with the Kauravas and supported them. He even gave a few words of encouragement to the Kauravas (as if they needed any) and passed lewd comments. Draupadi was shocked by Karna's behavior as she remembered him as a real gentleman and great warrior. Finally Sri Krishna came to her rescue that day. Most of this story is known to many who have read Mahabharata or have watched the TV series.  However the interesting question is why didn't Karna say anything to stop the brutality that day? There are many different stories regarding this but one interpretation which I found plausible was that Karna was trying to instigate the Pandavas who were sitting like ducks and letting all these monstrosity go on. Karna could not do anything directly for Draupadi because he was bound by his friendship to the Kauravas and also if he tried to intervene people would raise eyebrows and gossips will start that Karna has a weakness for Draupadi. In reality he did have a weakness for her and that is why he was extra careful not to let his feelings show.He thought that the only way he could stop it is by inciting the Pandavas. He tried to do it by saying things like  ""Draupadi you should leave the Pandavas who are cowards and don't know how to protect you and instead marry the Kauravas."" All this was actually said to anger the Pandavas and push them into doing something to stop the horrible injustice on Draupadi. Alas they just fell on deaf ears.  While that was Karna's actual motive Draupadi thought that Karna still nurtured the grudge against her for publicly humiliating him during the Sayamvar and that is why he behaved so harshly and did not help her. Draupadi lost the soft spot she had for Karna after this incident until much later when Sri Krishna revealed to her Karna's actual motives that day. P.S.

You are asking this question as taught by Lord Macaulay. YOU can decide and know the reality in the following description. The new education policy of Lord Macaulay cut off the Indians from the Indian culture by dividing the converted and non-converted Indians into Hindu Religion and Muslim Religions Hindu was never a Religion of India the term Hindy Religion was coined by the British for divide and rule policy Lord Macaulay taught that the Vedas are religious scriptures of Hindu and ‘Aryan’ came from outside of India and killed Dravid black south Indians with the opium of religious superstition the discovery Grand Canyon an advanced Vedic Civilization in 1909 supported the Aryan invasion theory and we accepted it which is in the blood of Indians with mental slavery of Britain hence we have no pain for the so-called Religious bifurcation of India with less nationality it has pushed India in Religious fundamentalism. ‘JAMBU DWIP’ KNOWN TURTLE EYE LAND as Pangaea is the oldest where first humans came into the existence and later due to the shifting of the continents separated by different environmental conditions with different stages of mental evolution.Earth was one land mass For hundreds of millions of years all the land of Earth was joined together in one large mass or supercontinent. Scientists call it Pangaea (meaning “all lands” in Greek).d mass in India called ‘JAMBU DWIP’ or ‘Turtle Eye Land’ At the place of the Great Himalayan range there was a ‘Thesis sea’ Pangaea existed about 240 million years ago. By about 200 million years ago The collision of the Indian subcontinent and Asian continent created the Himalayan mountain range home to the world's highest mountain peaks plate tectonics which contributed to the creation of continents. The plate tectonics and Earth’s geomagnetism played a great role in the splitting of the continents a part. Pangaea existed about 240 million years ago. By about 200 million years ago this supercontinent began breaking up. Over millions of years Pangaea separated into pieces that moved away from one another. ) ..Tethys SeaAbout 225 million years ago India was a large island still situated off the Australian coast and a vast ocean (called Until 65 million years ago a great ocean the Tethys sea separated India from Asia. There were no Himalayas and no Tibetan Plateau. Continental Drift Theory Continental Drift Theory was put forward by the German scientist Alfred Wegner in 1915. According to the Continental Drift Theory The parts of the crust are capable of horizontal movement around the globe causing the continents to slowly change their positions in relation to one another with plate tectonics. The fact that South America is a mirror image of Africa is presented as proof of the continental drift theory (see the video below for an animation showing the migration of both of these continents). For hundreds of millions of years all the land of Earth was joined together in one large mass or supercontinent. Scientists call it Pangaea (meaning “all lands” in Greek). Then about 200 million years ago the land began to drift apart. It broke into two pieces and scientists have called the continent in the north Laurasia and the continent in the south Gondwanaland (named by Eduard Suess an Austrian geologist).The two large continents continued to break apart into the smaller continents that exist today. Scientists call this movement ‘continental drift.Forces responsible for the drifting of continents (According to Alfred Wegner) Indians kept a record of the beginning of the creation ‘jyotirlinga’ the beginning of the Time Era Yuga Introduction Ancient Indian History is not like the history written by western Historians and Archaeologists. They have kept records in Veda the oldest literary monument of human civilization on the earth. The creation is working as a system under the cycle of the year ‘Samvatsar Kal’ they have not mentioned their name date or year. We were unknown before birth and will be unknown after death. For whom we should write history. The rotation of the sun at its axis has given the concept of time as a great event MAHAKAL’ Jyotirlinga at Ujjain as one wheel chariot and the twelve ‘Jyotirlinga’ in India represents Twelve fellies Twelve ‘Aditya’ twelve faces of the sun with 360 days cycle of one ‘Samvatsar Kal’ under which the creation is working as a system under the cycle of six seasons. Twelve are the fellies and the wheel is single; three are the naves. What man hath understood it? Therein are set together spokes three hundred and sixty which in nowise can be loosened. Rig. 1-164-48 It has been indicated here that all the phenomena on the earth are going on under the wheel of the year. It has twelve months and three hundred and sixty days with three centers Sky the Atmosphere and the earth. It indicates the yearly cycle of the months and seasons. Under the wheel of the year nature exhibits its functions.Great Event Mahakal ‘jyotirlinga’ the beginning of the Time Era YugaKedareshwar Cave Temple is located at Harishchandragad a hill fort in the Ahmednagar district. The fort is a popular trekking location. Kedareshwar Cave Temple is much different from other temples. It is situated in a cave and also the presence of water all year round makes the temple one of the unique temples not just in Maharashtra but in India as well. A Shiva Linga ‘Jyotirlinga’ of about five feet is situated at the center of the cave. One has to wade through waist-deep and ice-cold water to reach the Shiva Linga. Though there were four pillars surrounding the Linga now there is only one pillar intact. Some believe the pillars to be symbols of yuga or time namely Satya Tretha Dwapara and the Kali Yuga. Great Event Mahakal ‘jyotirlinga’ the beginning of the Time Era Yuga Veda is the first word of a civilized person on Earth. The world is suffering from the superstition of modern development which is only halfway to touching the Vedic height of development. The modern development of science and technology has created a threat to the existence of life on the earth with global warming depletion of the ozone layer with the ‘Green House Effect’ and the threat of Nuclear war to destroy the present civilization. Vedas are not religious scriptures. Upnishads are not Veda Puranas were written to teach the original evolution of the creation in a symbolic anthropomorphic manner to preserve the Vedic knowledge with the personification of natural forces as demons and deities it has been turned into myths of mythology with a long history and fancy of the narrator. Without the full knowledge of the creation and life on the earth Vedic word symbols are like Black Buffalo’ no History No Religion nor a God is Black Era ‘Kali Yuga’ Yuga Era ( Sanskrit : युग) means ""a yoke "" (joining of two things) ""generations"" or ""a period of time"" Era such as age namely Satya Yuga Treta Yuga Dwapar Yuga and the Kali Yuga. Satya Yuga  signifies the era of the beginning of the creation all was pure no duality. Treta Yuga the evolution of the human species with three immortal and self-consciousness. Lord Ram represents immortal fundamental energy ‘Sita’ Sarasvati immortal phonon wave and Laxman immortal Electron. With the trinity of the three immortal the civilization evolved with the monkey brigade first and from the monkey the human species evolved with the conflict between the devils and demons as ‘SUR AND ASUR’ Dwapar Yuga the duality increased with the selfishness created conflict in the society. Lord Krishna has supreme fundamental energy enlightened to fight for right. Kali Yuga Black Era no ethics no God no Duty in life ignorant of the aim of life on the earth. It is a symbolic representation of the history of the creation and evolution of civilization on earth. With regards Dr. C.P.

I have been studying from Gita Press and have studied from Prabhupada’s Gita and I would say Gita Press has some strengths. For example it is much more concise than Prabhupada’s. I am someone who appreciates concise translation more than expounding. I find a small volume much more friendly. Even though Prabhupada supplies a simple translation the commentary adds so much length and takes a long time to get through. Also one cannot help but to notice that Prabhupada pays much more attention to Bhakti Yoga than the other forms of yoga Krishna speaks of. It is very evident and structured by Prabhupada’s commentary that he wants to take you to bhakti yoga undermine dhyana yoga because it is not for this age he says and also undermine sankhya yoga and jnana yoga despite Krishna speaking all of them. Krishna is showing yoga from many aspects not just Bhakti but with Prabhupada it seems he is always leading us to the conclusion that we need to do nama kirtana and that hare krishna is the only option because it is the best mantra according to the upanishad he quotes. Yet the Vedas and yoga offer many different paths as Krishna mentions and they are suited towards different temperaments. Prabhupada doesn’t want to acknowledge this but wants everyone chanting Hare Krishna. This was his mission. In my personal experience chanting Hare Krishna is fine and has its effects but I prefer other practices and I see myself benefiting from them more because they are more for my temperament. I find Prabhupada’s vision too narrow. I have great respect for him though he taught me a lot about Bhakti but I felt in the end his way was too narrow and I embrace the Gita on a more broad interpretation. And I do not reject Krishna as the personality of Godhead. But I simply think there is more to it. If you get into with the Iskcon people their attitude practically speaking is to exalt the traditions of their particular Gaudiya Vaishnavism above all else. If I had a greater penchant to worshipping the Lord in the form of Krishna and performing Bhakti yoga in the manner that they do then I would follow them but I have taken the path of Jesus Christ I read the Gita and follow Bhakti yoga in my own way that does not involve nama kirtana in the way they do it. I also find the lack of proper succession in leadership a big flaw in the ISKCON movement. They have done a great good though in spreading the enthusiasm of the Lord through the Gita and Nama kirtana it was part of my spiritual evolution.,Marcus Rodriguez-Tenes,https://www.quora.com/profile/Marcus-Rodriguez-Tenes

As I discuss in this answer about the birth of the Kauravas Gandhari was pregnant with the Kauravas for two years. Dhritarashtra was worried that Gandhari would never give birth so as a precaution he decided to have a son with a Vaishya woman as described in chapter of the Adi Parva of the Mahabharata. In any case as I discuss in this answer Yuyutsu was a virtuous individual who switch to the Pandava side in the Mahabharata war and he served as a regent when the Pandavas left their kingdom to Arjuna's grandson Parikshit. And in addition to his 101 sons Dhritarashtra also had a daughter named Duhsala. She was born the same way as the 100 Kauravas as I discuss in this answer.

In the Mahabharata Krishna plays a central role along with others like Arjun Bhim Yudhishthir and so many others. In fact there are so many that a list of ‘major’ names can itself be a separate article. As anyone familiar with the epic might already know the Mahabharata revolves around the Pandavas and the Kauravas. The Pandavas were the five sons of Pandu namely Yudhishthir Bhim Arjun Nakul Sahadev. The Kauravas were descendants of the legendary king Kuru. They were many in number with the more famous ones being Duryodhana and Dushasana. In the epic’s central war or the Mahabharata Yudh many weapons have been used. Herein I’m enlisting the 10 most powerful weapons used in the Mahabharata Katha in increasing order of their capacity. 1. VASAVI SHAKTI2. VAJRA3. NARAYANASTRA4. BRAHMASTRA5. BRAHMASHIRSHA6.

The main objection of people regarding Sita was that Ravan approached Sita in the form of a ‘Bhikshuk’ and as a ‘Brahmin’ he was perfectly eligible to do that and Sita after transgressing Laxman Rekha went with Ravan on her own free will. As such Shri Ram had no reason to attack Lanka kill unaccountable people and then ‘forcibly’ bring Sita back.  Lot of confusion has been created regarding the role of Shri Ram in Agni Pariksha of Sita. The question still remains to be answered whether Shri Ram supported or opposed Agni Pariksha.  Returning back to Ayodhya after killing Ravana Ram was coroneted as king of Ayodhya. Shri Ram was the king who had inherited the throne of great King Dasrath which was subsequently and ably ruled by Bharat on behalf of Shri Ram. They had an efficient system of obtaining feedback from the public on the basis of which laws were made for the welfare of the public  And now King Ram was receiving these feedbacks. Some of these feedbacks were very disturbing. They were all about Sita and how she could not be accepted back as queen after staying with Ravan. Initially these feedbacks were ignored. Slowly these feedbacks started increasing and dissatisfaction became much more apparent. Something had to be done.  But Ram is not called Maryada Purushottam just as a mark of respect. He always respected the existing tradition (Maryada) of that time. Shri Rama respected the citizens. He respected the people's talks. He declared that Sita had to pass the Agni Pariksha test so that he could accept her back. Laxman strongly opposed this. Yet the victorious army chief insisted that Agni Pariksha was the only thing which could make him accept her. Sita agreed and after the satisfactory completion of the ritual ‘Agni Pariksha’ Shri Ram gladly accepted her back as his wife.  Ram did it not because he personally doubted Sita but because of the demands of his dharma as a king; he knew she was innocent but he had to show his praja (subject) that unlike his father he was not a slave to a woman that as a just raja he was willing to make any amount of personal sacrifices for them. It was an act of sacrifice for him as well. He suffered no less and lived an ascetic life thereafter.  Our king might accept a wife who had stayed in another man’s home but not me – On hearing a washer man question the purity of the Queen of Ayodhya Lord Ram decides to send a pregnant Mata Sita to the forest. Rama is the ideal king and for a modern reader this is heights of stupidity and absurdity. A modern reader would want Lord Ram to stand by his wife and defend her and not to fall for the irresponsible prattle of his foolish subjects.  If Lord Ram had sent the washer man questioning the purity of Mata Sita to prison he would be performing the duty of a husband. But will he be performing the duty of a King? Lord Ram could have beheaded the washer man on the spot. But will he be able behead all those people that questions the purity of Mata Sita. Lord Ram would have become a dictator! Would we worship such a Lord Ram today? Hence Shri Rama never doubted Sita.,Jaydeep Parmar,https://www.quora.com/profile/Jaydeep-Parmar-8

What is the meaning of chitraguptha and its corresponding entity in Jiva (terminology yama interpretation nirukta chitra Gupta Hinduism)?,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-meaning-of-chitraguptha-and-its-corresponding-entity-in-Jiva-terminology-yama-interpretation-nirukta-chitra-Gupta-Hinduism,,One of the Telugu scholars Garikapati Narasimha Rao defined it the best. He says it's not Chitragupta but Chittagupta (chitta = mind soul…..depends on how you want to call it). It's your soul keeping track of your words and deeds omissions and commissions. So it's not an actual guy writing down what you do in your life but it's your soul keeping track of it. And you reap what you sow.

Why is Lord Rama said to be very patient even though he himself failed to preserve his own patience with Lord Ocean within 3 days?Lord Rama tried to attack lord ocean the one whom he himself was worshiping for the past 3 days. He failed miserably to preserve his own patience. Can you still call him patient ? On the contrary we are taught to remain patient for the whole life no matter how poor the situation is.Let me tell you about some portion of the time line of Ramayana. Lord Ram was sent to Vanvaas (exile in the forest) for 14 years. Their life in forest went well for 13 years. In the last year Ravana abducted Sita. It is said that Lord Ram and Lady Sita again united after 9 months. That means after the abduction of Lady Sita she was away from Lord Ram for nine months. Now let’s see how many days were taken to build the Ram-Setu (Adam’s bridge). The duration of the battle between Ram and Ravana. The Great War started on Phalguna Krishna tritiya (3) and ended on Phalguna Amavasya (new moon day) when Ravana was killed. So the battle duration was 13 days. Subtract 13 days from 9 months. This equates to 8 months and 17 days. The peace talks and emissary took 3 days. So it becomes 8 months and 14 days. Source:- Astronomical Dating of the Ramayan Time taken to build the Ram-Setu: It is said that the bridge was 100 yojanas (ancient Indian unit of measuring distances) long.14 yojanas were constructed on the first dayNext 20 yojanas were built on the 2nd dayOn 3rs day 21 yojanas were built.22 yojanas were covered on the fourth dayRest 23 yojanas were completed on the fifth day.The above description can be found in Yuddha Kanda [22nd Sarga 66-70 Slokas of Srimad Ramayana]Subtract 5 days from 8 months and 14 days. This equates to 8 months and 9 days. Was Lord Ram really impatient? According to the question after being separated from Lady Sita Lord Ram lost his patience after 8 months and 9 days. He lost his patience because the Lord of Oceans didn’t respond to his plea. Lord Ram didn’t lose his patience. He was moved by the apathetic and the emotionless attitude of the Lord of Oceans. If Lord Ram would have been impatient then:Why did he try to attack Lord of Oceans after 3 days of worship. He had the capability of drying up the ocean. He could have dried up ocean sooner on the first day or the second day.He could have even dried up the ocean without even worshipping and requesting the Lord of Oceans. But he worshiped him as a humble person.He could have dried up the ocean instead of building a bridge. When he threatened the Lord of Oceans he came in front of Ram and requested him to build a bridge. Building a bridge needs a lot of time. If Ram would have been impatient he wouldn’t have wasted time to build a bridge and would have dried up the ocean to save time so that he could reach Sita sooner.Seems like Lord Ram didn’t lose his patience. He actually threatened the Lord of Oceans to teach him humility. He wanted to teach the Lord of Oceans to be sympathetic towards people who are in trouble.,Satyarth Routroy,https://www.quora.com/profile/Satyarth-Routroy

But my definition of Karma has nothing to do with vengeance. When I got cheated upon by my ex husband and found out within six months of marriage all I wanted was revenge. “ something bad should happen to him he should suffer like I did I should go out of my way to cause him hurt"" and then I realised all of that was nothing but bullshit. First of all what happens with people who hurt me is not in my control. I am neither their conscience keeper nor their moral compass and its not my job to ensure they get punished for being assholes. People play the roles they want to play and if they choose to play an asshole that's about it. I cannot do anything about it but what is in my control is how I choose to let or not let their dumbfuckery define my life. When you bear grudges against people who hurt you you allow them to take up space in your life. The moment you disassociate from them saying that “ This person is toxic for me and I need to stand up for myself now I need to protect myself now"" you remove them out of your picture. The moment you do that its over. Now whether they die or live or get punished or instead flourish is none of your business because its not your picture. Yes there is a feeling of vindication when you see someone who hurt you suffer and pay for their actions  directly or indirectly I will not deny that. But that joy never lasts long term. Because Karma is not about them. Karma is about you and your picture. Karma is going through absolute shit hell and coming back right up like a queen. I am of course not talking about legal cases. When I was going through my divorce which itself is a painful process altogether thats what I told myself. THIS IS MY PICTURE. THIS IS MY PICTURE. THIS IS MY PICTURE. And only me and the people I love and care about are in that picture. Assholes Out.This is the day I found out my ex husband was sleeping around with multiple women. The world seemed to come to an end with everything crashing around me. And this is me two years later back on my feet a published author several writing projects in hand going to hospital and doing my duties as a doctor all through the pandemic teaching undergrad students and living my life to the fullest without holding back.     This is my Karma. That I got my life back despite hitting rock bottom. That the world seemed to end except it didn't. That I got closer to where I want to be in life. That I became the woman I always wanted to be. And that I could smile again laugh again live again be Me again. They say Karma is a bitch. Thats true. Karma is that bitch who says “ Hey I am not letting you give up. You and me we are gonna get through this and we are gonna rock”.",Pallavi,https://www.quora.com/profile/Pallavi-999
Was king Pushiyamitra Shung and Lord Ram same person?,https://www.quora.com/Was-king-Pushiyamitra-Shung-and-Lord-Ram-same-person,,According to Hindu mythology Pushiyamirta Shunga was a king from the Shunga dynasty who ruled ancient India during the 2nd century BCE. However Lord Rama is a central figure in Hinduism and is considered the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu. He is considered to be one of the most revered deities in Hinduism and is the hero of the ancient Indian epic poem the Ramayana. Pushiyamirta Shunga and Lord Rama are two different person Pushiyamirta Shunga was a historical king who lived in the 2nd century BCE while Lord Rama is a divine figure an incarnation of Lord Vishnu who is believed to have lived at an earlier time approximately in the 8th century BCE. It's worth noting that the Ramayana is a poem and the story of Lord Rama is a mythological tale and the exact timing of the story is not clear. Some versions of the Ramayana place Rama in a much earlier time period while others place him in a later time period. Therefore it is not possible to say whether Lord Rama and Pushiyamirta Shunga are the same person or not.,Kâran Pařđhan,https://www.quora.com/profile/K%C3%A2ran-Pa%C5%99%C4%91han

Being religious will make you look good in front of society but being spiritual will please god.To visit holy place is being religious but to practice holiness for yourself is being spritual. To recite prayer in temple is being religious to develop a prayerful heart is being spiritual.To wear Tilak marks beads is being religious to decorate your inside heart is being spiritual. In front of being spiritual other all are zeroes. But that doesn't mean we should deride ritualistic practices. These are carried from generations to generation.

If Lord Bramha can have a lifespan why not Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu?,https://www.quora.com/If-Lord-Bramha-can-have-a-lifespan-why-not-Lord-Shiva-and-Lord-Vishnu,https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-94558f95e8690dc3b5c1cc0ad27d8f8b-pjlq,Lord Brahma has a lifespan of 311.04 trillion years.

Thus Lord Brahma obtains liberation only after the end of the lifespan of the universe. Since he finally attains liberation he is said to have a lifespan. Now coming to the lifespan Continue ReadingLord Brahma has a lifespan of 311.04 trillion years. This is also the lifespan of the universe. When the universe undergoes dissolution Brahma attains liberation. Since Brahma is most of the time a living entity (jiva) who has been appointed by Lord Vishnu to carry out the secondary creation (visarga) of the material world he is bound by his duties to assist Lord in administrative functions of the universe. Thus Lord Brahma obtains liberation only after the end of the lifespan of the universe. Since he finally attains liberation he is said to have a lifespan. Now coming to the lifespan of Lord Shiva this is a bit complicated for Lord Shiva’s expansions operate at different levels. Let me attempt to explain this concisely based on the understanding of various scriptures and commentaries of our various acharyas. Lord Sankara who is situated in the material world in mount Kailash is generally not a living entity or a jiva though some of his other Rudra expansions could be jivas and thus have lifespans. The form of Lord Sankara is not an immediate or personal expansion of Lord Vishnu such as Lord Varaha Matsya etc but is considered a separated expansion of Lord Vishnu. He is different from both jiva tattva and Vishnu tattva and has his own category known as Siva-tattva. Lord Sankara has a lifespan in the sense that he executes his duties of destruction as appointed by Lord Vishnu for the particular duration of the universe but there is no question of liberation for him unlike Lord Brahma who is a jiva. He only becomes unmanifest. At the end of the Maha-Kalpa Lord Sankara only merges back in his original form of Lord Sambhu who is situated in Mahesha Dhama outside the material world. When the new cycle of universal creation begins Lord Sankara again manifests through the glance of Maha-Vishnu from Lord Sambhu via Garbhodakaśāyī Vishnu and again resumes his duties through his various Rudra expansions. The duration of the manifestation of Lord Sambhu who is considered the divine halo of Lord Maha-Vishnu is equivalent to the duration of the one wink of Lord Maha-Vishnu during which hundred universal durations get completed or a hundred Brahmas get liberated. Thus Lord Sambhu also has a life span in the sense of being constantly involved in the flux of universal manifestations and un-manifestations. However in its original form Lord Sambhu eternally exists in his form of Lord Sadashiva in His Sadashiva-Loka which is situated in the northeast part of Vaikuntha-Loka. This aspect of Lord Shiva has eternal manifestation and no un-manifestation thus Lord Sadashiva has no life span for He is eternal. He is non-different from Lord Maha-Vishnu and exists in the same category as Vishnu-tattva expansions. With regard to the Lord Mahavishnu He has no un-manifestation for the creation and destruction of the universes happen perpetually thus Lord Maha-Vishnu has no life span. The same applies to all the avatars of the Lord. They only appear and disappear but exist eternally in their various Vaikuntha dhamas. Just to give an indication of the life span of Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva Matsya Purana 289.21–22 states‘’Hundred years of Lord Brahma is equal to one year of Lord Shiva and hundred years of Lord Shiva is equal to one wink of Lord Maha-Vishnu who is eternal. When Lord Vishnu awakes all the creations blossom and when the Lord sleeps all the creations get absorbed into the Lord Maha-Vishnu.’’Thus to summarize Brahma has a life span for he is mostly jiva and attains liberation at the end of his life span. However except few Rudra expansions Lord Sankara and Lord Sambhu although not a jiva-tattva (Siva-tattva) has a life span in the sense of becoming manifest and unmanifest in relation to the universal affairs. However Lord Sadashiva has no life span for He eternally remains manifested in Vaikuntha Dhama. Finally Lord Vishnu also has no life span for He is eternal.

Keeping the beliefs  the rituals and the age old traditions aside  thinking logically banning the entry of women or a particular sex in that matter to any place in today's times is stupid. Whatever the reason might have been for such a practice to be in existence for this long  it was about time we had a judgement which would grant women th rights to enter the temple.But if this is gonna be the jist of my answer then I would be wrong in more ways than one.Source- Google images Firstly this problem is multilayered. Sabarimala is Lord ayyappa's abode and devotees every year follow a strict schedule over a two month period before making the visit to the temple. I personally have seen people wake up at 4 in the morning take cold water baths  refer to people as swamy inshort denouncing the worldly pleasures for a specific duration. So basically it is all a question of belief and their faith in the almighty. The perennial question is why are women not allowed in the temple? Legend says that when lord ayyappa slayed a demon she was relieved of her curse and a maiden(Malikapurathamma )appeared. She then asked him to marry her and when ayyappa rejected her proposal saying that he needs to go to sabarimala with his devotees and would come to her only once the first-time devotees stop coming to the hills she has been in a never ending wait . And women thus are not allowed in as a sign of respect to Malikapurathamma’s persistence. These are stuffs of the legends. Now the problems prevalent are lack of facilities for women  the possible public outrage that this decision may cause and some political reasons.Source-Google Images What makes this scenario interesting is the location of the temple. The temple is in the state of Kerala the most literate state of our country and a state where political affiliation holds more value than your religious credentials . It's either the communists or the RSS. And quite clearly neither are ready to concede an inch. And if the violent protests from yesterday are anything to go by  things are hardly expected to change. So is the supreme Court right or wrong? Let's break down the decision in simple terms. One  this is not any one of those gender inequality issues we come across in our daily lives. This right here is a question of belief. Women from sabarimala and staunch devotees aren't willing to enter the premises even after supreme Court decision. So yes as I said earlier it's complex. But that doesn't mean that the protests taking place there can be justified. It's lawlessness at it's peak where police are being outnumbered by these hooligans. Women who are willing to enter are being beaten media persons being thrashed and every known human boundary crossed ironically in the name of God. And then come the profit makers. Political parties are seeing it as a potential vote bank for the next elections and are actively participating in public instigation. I still don't understand how they expect us to digest the bullshit they feed us in the name of press conferences where they try convincing that they are all in it for the welfare of the people.Source- Google Images How could I not bring the media people into this. Yes the situation is complicated people are irked hooligans are vandalizing public properties and even women there . It's common sense that it is risky for a woman to be there. Forget your inclusiveness or gender bridge or whatever  it makes no sense to send female journalists on ground zero when you know you are exposing them to potential harm. Can the greed for 2–3 TRP points make them forget the basic fact that they could be risking lives of personnel there amidst all this madness? Now the female angle. Yes  whatever the reason is  denying entry or prohibiting a particular gender from a place of worship that too is baseless. Every person irrespective of gender has the right to go and pray to the deity they want to without anyone intimidating them. But the simple question I want to ask is where is this issue on the priority order? What priority order? Let me explain. Menstrual hygiene of women  patriarchy prevalent everywhere in the society (even this is an example but let me tell how this ones different)  and more recently women coming out against sexual predators and harassers in the open and getting rid of demons of their past. Amidst all these issues  I somehow wonder if the sabarimala issue is something that deserves all the attention that it has been receiving. Speaking of political motivationSource- Google Images So ending my answer I'd say  women have every right to go worship in sabarimala. But why rush knowing that people are plotting every move of theirs right now to make personal gains. Let the government make proper arrangements first  let people be addressed on the issue and let the regressive ones be told how their thinking stinks. Let us not allow people to play politics and the religion card on this topic at least. Thank you,Chinmay Kuchinad,https://www.quora.com/profile/Chinmay-Kuchinad-1

She is beyond Mortality or immortality She is the one who grants Them she is Para Shakti :“I bow down to the extremely famous one the paramatman who exists in all bodies. He is Narayana. He is the universe. He is without qualities. He possesses all the qualities in his atman. It is through his favours that Rudra was generated from Brahma’s rage. He is the womb of everything mobile and immobile. O supreme among those who possess sattva! He possesses the eighteen qualities of sattva. After methere is Prakriti who holds up heaven and earth through her yoga. She is truth. She is immortal. She is invincible. She is the consciousness in the worlds. Everything the transformations of creation and destruction flow from her.”(Source : Mahabharata chapter 1656 [328] BORI)She is the basic essence The Ultimate Boundary and the Soul of The universe.“I created the sky which is (as a shelter) above the earth and which is fatherly for all beings. My creativity (power) is within the Ocean and waters. By that I am present in all the worlds. And I touch the sky with my body. When I start creating all the worlds I function like the air (so fast in the function). I am taller and higher than the Sky. I am greater than this earth. Such is my valor might prowess and greatness.”(Source : Devi suktam Rig veda) In the words of Maharishi Parasara too nothing exists beyond Her and Narayana :“Oh thou who knowest what righteousness is Govinda is love; and Lakṣmī his gentle spouse is pleasure. But why thus diffusely enumerate their presence: it is enough to say in a word that of gods animals and men Hari is all that is called male; Lakṣmī is all that is termed female: there is nothing else than they.”(Source : Sri Vishnu Puran Book 1 chapter 8) Now if You're referring to Her birth then Her Emergence at Samudra manthan was For material world only In reality she resides Eternally With Lord adi Narayana The parameswara In their abode called Vaikuntha.~Jankaiye❤,Daśanāmi Vaiṣṇava,https://www.quora.com/profile/Da%C5%9Ban%C4%81mi-Vai%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%87ava

Hindus are mushriks i.e. people having a concept of God different from Islam (this includes polytheism idolatry henotheism etc).Islam doesn't teach us to kill every non-Muslim around us. Every single verse of the Quran that talks about fighting is related to some battle or the other that was raging between the Muslims and the hostile tribes around them. You can find the context of every such verse in the verses preceding or succeeding it. Remember apart from being a religious entity Islam also emerged as a political entity. Prophet Mohammad in addition to being a spiritual leader was also the political leader of the newly formed and growing Muslim empire. As for dealing with general non-Muslims around us Quran clearly and unambiguously states the following:Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed Allah loves those who act justly.(Quran 60:8) The all-covering black baggy thing called Burqa isn't mandatory in Islam. (Alqama's answer to Why don't all Muslim wear Burqa?)Saudi Arabia isn't our Vatican nor the King of Saudi our Pope. So whatever Saudi or its king does has no relevance to us. Nor are they the guardians of Islam or the descendants of the Prophet. Just the twin cities of Mecca and Madina are our holy sites. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia came into existence only in 1932.We aren't running any Love Jihad racket. Deception and lying are among the biggest sins in Islam. Nor are we plotting to turn India into an Islamic state. We have got a normal life just like you.

Do atheists secretly believe in God?,https://www.quora.com/Do-atheists-secretly-believe-in-God,,A contrary data point: a friend of mine ran a discussion group for atheists in Alabama. From time to time he'd get fundamentalist Christians trying to infiltrate the group hoping to hear something scandalous that they could use to discredit the group. After a while he discovered that a foolproof test to head off trouble was to ask new members why they became atheists. Real atheists would typically say unprompted something to the effect that the idea of a God just stopped making sense or started to seem like any old fairy tale. Interlopers would go on about how they were mad at God which of course is a common theist conceit about atheists that fairly openly disregards the usual definition as in bad faith. But it's not in bad faith - atheists really don't take the idea of God seriously even talking among themselves in private.,Mark Barton,https://www.quora.com/profile/Mark-Barton-1

Photos of Lepakshi Temple Read More on Lepakshi Temple About the Place Legend and History The origination of name Lepakshi has two myths associated with it. According to the first legend Lepakshi found its roots in the legendary Ramayana when Ravana had kidnapped Sita. As he was taking her away the bird Jataya tried saving her from his hand. Defeated by Ravana he fell on the floor. As he was counting his last breathe Lord Rama helped him attain Moksha by saying 'Le Pakshi' which in Telugu means 'Rise Bird.' Hence the name Lepakshi originated. According to another legend there were two brothers in the Vijayanagar Kingdom - Virupanna and Veerupanna. Virupanna's son was blind and it is said that he gained sightedness while he was playing around the Shivalinga in the temple. Veerupanna was one of the financiers of Vijayanagar. Blamed by others for using the royal treasury; some say for the completion of the temple while some say for curing his son the king gave orders for taking off his eyes. Disturbed by the false accusation he forestalled the punishment and threw his eyes onto the walls of the temple. Hence the place got its name Lape-Akshi meaning the village of the blinded. Now the eerie part is that the temple wall still has the blood marks of the eyes.

Those people who come from a purely materialistic viewpoint they do not know what to do and what not to do when to engage in something and when not to. They are bound to do things in a haphazard and messy way. Shri Krishna says that such people do not have purity. Furthermore their conduct towards others their behavior will also be messy and haphazard. They will lack good manners courtesy and politeness. It also follows that when someone does not know the pros and cons of anything they will not place a lot of importance on doing things the right way. So if they do not get the result they want they have no hesitation in getting their results by lying cheating and deceit. They do not want to wait for the result because waiting takes time. If there is a shortcut they will go for it. Such is the value system of the aasuri the devilish the materialistic viewpoint. Shree Krishna states that the demoniac nature is confused about what is right and what is wrong and thus neither purity nor truth nor right conduct is found in them.,Ojas Shrivastava,https://www.quora.com/profile/Ojas-Shrivastava-11

The tug-of-war between the boy and the god of death ended when Shiva emerged from his linga and kicked Yama away. Markandeya declared that Shiva is Yamantaka he who destroys Yama.

On our way just before we reached I woke up and started looking out the window I saw soo many people walking towards Darbar Sahib I was shocked for some reason. I didn't expect any one to be going to the Gurdwara at this time and especially not in the amounts I saw. It was a dark night and a cold one. We reached golden temple the outside lights shining bright. As I climbed up the steps..Slowing I could see the golden reflection As I reached up just before making the descent again I froze. (Shri Darbar sahib is built at lover level of ground than normal ground.) It was a moment like no other…. The beauty. The silence. The peace. Unimaginable words.I couldn't lift my eyes off from Darbar Sahib how perfectly it shined in the Sarovar. I couldn't describe the feeling in a million words. I felt connected I felt near to God. I didn't want to leave that day.. The silence was amazing soo peaceful and blissful. There was no rush no race. Every moment could be enjoyed to its limit. I took soo many photos that day in hope that I could capture the beauty in my phone but it's impossible. It was a experience like no other on the universe. Pictures included are of 3 months ago but you can get a idea what it looks like in the night. I always go at night now.

To keep friendship and to keep his word he behaved very badly and unethically with Pandavas. So he was not respected by public. But he was always admired and depended on by Kauravas.

Who is greatest among Brahma Vishnu and Mahesh and why?,https://www.quora.com/Who-is-greatest-among-Brahma-Vishnu-and-Mahesh-and-why,https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-18d216fce12cf915524b509973715bc6-lq,"Who is greatest among Brahma Vishnu and Mahesh?To learn about this answer you have to go way behind in time and learn about the origin. Let's start. Before the origin of this universe before the origin of Big Bang Theory way before the arrival of Milky Way Galaxy there was something known as “Point Zero”. Point Zero is something known as “Omkar” in Hindu culture. In point zero there was nothing no planets no universe no stars no celestial bodies nothing except for one big point of energy at the centre of nowhere like a vaccum. Now from that point zero aka Omkar Vishnu erupted. But his eyes were closed. He remained in that state for thousands of years. During the flow of time Brahma was erupted from the belly button of Vishnu. Again his eyes were closed too. They both floated for thousands of years. Finally a moment came and they collided with each other. Their eyes opened together at the same time. Brahma thought that Vishnu was created by him although Vishnu tried to convince him that he was born from Vishnu's belly button. They had a big argument about who erupted first and who was the greatest. Suddenly a voice came from the “Point Zero"" that was Omkar. The point started to grow bigger and bigger. It turned out into a big immeasurable “Linga"". From that Linga the voice said “I will decide who is the greatest and who came first. The first one who is able to measure me and find my end point shall be regarded as the greatest of all.” After listening to that both Brahma and Vishnu started measuring the Linga but towards the opposite direction of each other. After traveling on the path of Linga for thousands of years Vishnu realised that it was infinite there was no end to it. The Linga will never end. However Brahma created an object that had voice in it and that said this is the end. Brahma stopped and went to meet Vishnu. Vishnu asked Brahma if he has found the end point of the Linga. Brahma told yes and showed him the object that he created and told that that object was the end of Linga. The moment he said that a voice came from Linga that was formed from point zero Omkar. It said “this is wrong. Brahma you are wrong.” Suddenly the Linga collapsed and formed into Shiva the point zero or Omkar was formed into Lord Shiva. He said Brahma was wrong and Brahma was formed from the belly button of Vishnu and he was the one who created Vishnu. He asked Vishnu about what he's got. Vishnu said that the Linga is infinite and there's no end to it. Shiva was impressed by the knowledge of Vishnu. He revealed that he himself was indeed the point zero and Omkar. He also revealed again that Vishnu was formed by his energy of Shiva and from the energy of Vishnu Brahma was formed. Shiva gave the boon to Vishnu that Vishnu shall be worshipped regardless of any Avatar he forms. But due to the ego of Brahma to prove himself as the superior one Brahma shall never be worshipped. Still he gave the power of creation to Brahma because Brahma was able to create the object that produced the sound. So Shiva gave the power of creation to Brahma the power of protection to Vishnu and he himself became the destroyer if anybody crosses the line and breaks his Dharma Shiva shall destroy. That's how all three were formed Shiva from the Omkar aka point zero Vishnu from the energy of Shiva and Brahma from the energy of belly button of Vishnu. All three of them are related to each other. One more story after the creation of this universe by Brahma all three of them decided to test their abilities. So the first test was for Brahma if he could take the energy of the remaining two. Both Vishnu and Shiva used their energies to destroy Brahma. Brahma was burnt into ashes due to the energy produced by Shiva and Vishnu. But Brahma was reformed from those ashes. Then Brahma and Shiva burnt Vishnu using their energies. And Vishnu was reformed from the ashes. Lastly both Vishnu and Brahma used their energies to burn Shiva into Ashes. Shiva was formed again. From that moment it was concluded that there's no greatest among three. All three of them were equal parts of each other. They cannot be destroyed. One last story to convince you when Adi Shakti the other part of Shiva took birth on Earth in the form of human body known as Shati it was essential for her to marry Shiva to get into her deity form. But Shiva was a deity not a human and Shati was half human half deity. At first Shiva denied marrying Sati. But after many attempts he agreed and finally married Sati. However Prajapati Daksh the son of Brahma who was a scholar at the time was the father of Sati and he hated Shiva. He never worshipped Shiva as a deity. One day after the marriage of Shiva Daksh decided to have a yagna. His other daughter went to invite Shati and Shiva. But Shiva was punishing Shati at the time because she misused her powers to time travel and test Shree Ram in the future. Shati changed her looks to appear like Sita. She went to Ram who immediately identified her as Adi Shakti and bowed before her. However Shiva didn't liked that move from Shati and isolated her because Shiva worshipped Sita. After the incident Shati promised her sister to bring Shiva to the yagna. But Shiva denied to go. So Shati went alone. By the moment she reached the palace of Daksh her sister who invited her was already forbidden from the palace due to inviting her and Shiva without consulting her father Daksh. The guards stopped Shati at the gate and told her she cannot take Nandi and other colleagues inside. When she went inside Daksh insulted her and Shiva to the limits. Shati lost her cool and vowed to burn herself in that hawan kund of yagna so that the ritual never becomes successful. As she sat on fire it didn't burn as the energy of fire was not able to burn her body. After witnessing her failed attempt Daksh got more furious and insulted Shiva and Shati more. When the water flew over the head Shati finally turned into full form of Adi Shakti who was just another part of Shiva. She used her own energy to burn her human body till death since was still in a human form and not a deity form her human part would still die. When Shiva realised that Shati burnt herself Shiva raged. He wanted to punish Prajapati Daksh and destroy everything in his path. He pulled out a few portion of his hair and formed his powerful version of Veer Bhadra from that hair. He ordered Bhadra to destroy everybody until Daksh is announced dead. Bhadra started killing all the armies of Daksha with Earth shaking powers. Not even the Gods were able to stop Bhadra. Daksha called Vishnu out of fear who had promised to protect him. To fulfill his promise Vishnu appeared before Bhadra and threw an electric force to prevent Bhadra from moving. After witnessing that the anger of Shiva reached it's peak. He pulled another hair from his head and formed Bhadra Kali. She was just another version of Shiva made for destruction only. Bhadra Kali entered the body of Veer Bhadra. As she got mixed with Veer Bhadra Bhadra was able to break the barricades of electric forces created by Vishnu. He destroyed the entire Narayani Sena of Vishnu. The only last option left for Vishnu to stop Veer Bhadra was to use to the Sudarshan Chakra. Daksha Prajapati asked Vishnu to use the Sudarshan Chakra to protect him. Vishnu told Daksha that he has successfully fulfilled his promise to protect Daksha. But he never promised to protect Daksh's life. He told Daksh that if his Sudarshan Chakra collides with Veer Bhadra and Bhadra Kali it would produce an enormous energy that would not only destroy the nine planets but the entire Solar System and the creation of Brahma as well because just like Sudarshan Chakra were the ultimate weapon of Vishnu Bhadra Kali and Veer Bhadra were the ultimate weapon of Shiva. To prevent the destruction of the universe Vishnu escaped out of the scene towards Baikunth. Finally Daksha was left alone and couldn't face the wrath of Veer Bhadra. He was finally killed after Vishnu failed to protect him and refused to use the nuclear Sudarshan Chakra. All these stories from Vishnu and Shiv Puranas tell us that all three deities are parts of one another. All of them cannot be destroyed and should never be compared. Only a fool will compare them because Vishnu respects and worships Shiva. Shiva respects and worships Vishnu. They both are acknowledged by Brahma and independent of each other who have their own roles to either create protect or destroy this universe. So the conclusion is that never compare the Trimurti. All three of them are greatest. Only a fool with ego problem like Prajapati Daksh will compare their powers. Hope this helps you.",Anamika Sharma,https://www.quora.com/profile/Anamika-Sharma-1137

I know it’s difficult but I want to marry my girlfriend who's Jewish and I want us to have a unified family. I also believe closer to Judaism’s view of Monotheism. Which rabbi can I speak to?Here are my thoughts:Ask her what she wants. If she doesn’t care maybe you don’t need to worry about it. According to Jewish law your children with her will be Jewish even if you don’t convert. You can still attend synagogue with your family and learn Hebrew the prayers the holidays etc.If you still want to convert you should probably convert to the same branch your girlfriend is. You would just call your local synagogue and find out if they have a conversion program. It’s usually at least 1 year or more of study and living the Jewish calendar year and you’ll be expected to learn to read Hebrew and if you’re not already circumcised that will also be an expectation. Even if you are already circumcised there is still a very easy ritual that will need to be done called hatafat dam brit.,Adam Reisman,https://www.quora.com/profile/Adam-Reisman

You’re definitely going to want medical attention if you can get it! As to what happens longer term that’s really going to depend on the nature of the injury. Low energy projectile might just make a hole that’s amenable to packing cautery or other local measures to stop bleeding. It could even clot on its own. If there are no signs of serious bleeding or complications patient might escape surgery but with any doubt surgeon will want to look around in there to see what kind of injury there is. Injury to biliary system potentially has very serious long term consequences. High energy projectile (eg rifle round) can for lack of a better word “pulpify” the liver and that’s a “problem”. Mortality there can be high. In part because chance of bleeding to death is significant and also because this can’t just be sewed up. Treatment may involve debridement partial liver resection or other measures. “Good news” is that compared to most other organs liver can heal itself relatively well and we can live with only a small fraction of liver. Bad news is there is no “artificial” liver you need it to live and you only have one so unlike (say) a lung or kidney it can’t just be removed.

Is Lord Shiva too innocent?,https://www.quora.com/Is-Lord-Shiva-too-innocent,https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a0fe54888bb54d305555eb8c5e5ca48f.webp | https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-43b23a34cb591a2fa860d0f5df06033d.webp,Yes. It's very easy to please God Shiva  and he grants the desired boons to His devotees and at times invites trouble to himself. That is why Shiva is often referred as Bholenath the innocent God.There was an Asur named Vakrasur (Bhasmasur) he did years of penance to please Shiva and at last Shiva gives Darshan and tells him to ask for any desired boon. Then the asur says “ Hey Lord give me a boon such  my touch on any living being’s head should turn them into ash ! Shiva grants him the boon thus the Asur became Bhasmasura. But that asur out of arrogance tries to test the authenticity of the boon on Shiva! ( the place where the Bhasmasura incident happened is Yana Karnataka).Then Lord Vishnu had to come in the form of mohini and put an end to Bhasmasura. This doesn't mean that Shiva can't protect himself. This shows his love towards his devotees and He never punishes them. Shiva destroys the arrogance / desires / lust in his devotees and thus dissolves them into Him. If Bhasmasura would have touched Shiva's head that asur would have turned into ash since Shiva is Rudra ( fire )  and no one can destroy or harm Shiva.Shiva always gives another chance for His devotees to change for the better  and live according to Dharma because Shiva can't be far away from his devotees for a longer time !There are many such instances  which proves Shiva's innocence.An asur named Vidhyunmaali asks God Shiva to be his body guard. And Shiva accepts that too. Then Mata Sati comes and seeing her ferocious form Vidhyunmaali frees Shiva from his word.Gajasur  a great devotee of Shiva asks Shiva to reside in his stomach. Shiva doesn't say no even to this wish and resides in Gajasur’s stomach. When Parvathi requests Lord Vishnu to get her husband Shiva back  Vishnu approaches Gajasur and brings back Shiva.When Ravana asks Shiva  to accompany him to Lanka and stay with him forever in Lanka  then Shiva goes in the form of AATMA Linga with Ravana.

What exactly is the problem between India and Pakistan?,https://www.quora.com/What-exactly-is-the-problem-between-India-and-Pakistan,https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b845efc7c0bed8a58661eacd12778a9e,Bloody Start: When the Britishers left India in 1947 some Muslims feared that they would not have a voice in the new Hindu nation. Indian leaders tried hard to stop the Muslims from splitting out but the negotiations failed. Thus a new nation of Pakistan was created out of a couple of Muslim-majority provinces in India's side.  The issue was that those provinces had a lot of non-Muslims too and India herself had plenty of Muslims elsewhere. In the months following India's independence in August 1947 millions were caught on the wrong side of the new border and were forced to move out. Millions died in the process. India blames Pakistan for all the Hindus & Sikhs that Pakistanis killed and Pakistan blames India for all the Muslims the Indians killed. Thus both nations started with bad blood.Border wars: Indian and Pakistan have fought 4 wars to deal with unresolved boundaries. Thrice the war was over the state of Jammu & Kashmir (whose monarch signed a deal to join with India) and once over India's decision to split Pakistan to create the new nation of Bangladesh. Indians are pissed that Pakistan sends its terrorists into Kashmir while Pakistan are pissed that they didn't get Kashmir.  That is pretty much all a layman outside the subcontinent needs to know to start with. As you understand the issue more deeply you can see different perspectives and different issues.,Balaji Viswanathan,https://www.quora.com/profile/%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B2%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%9C%E0%AE%BF-%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B8%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%A8%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%A9%E0%AF%8D-Balaji-Viswanathan

However for the propagation of these Vedas we need speech- hence Brahma created Saraswathi (that is why we say Saraswathi is the daughter of Brahma as she was created by him). Now for speech to be made we need knowledge or sense which are the Vedas and for Vedas to be told we need speech; hence the relationship of Brahma & Saraswathi is dampattya (that of a husband and a wife) as one cannot be without the other. This is often mistaken as the carnal desire of Brahma which is incorrect. As to why Brahma isn't worshiped there are 3 legends:Curse of Shiva: Brahma apparently had a 5th head which was extremely arrogant and often abused everybody in the vicinity. To put an end to this came Shiva and when the 5th head abused Shiva as well he cut off the 5th head with stuck on his hand. Shiva in turn was accused of Brahmahatya dosha(the killing of another person) and came down to earth to relieve himself of that curse. In Badri the lord himself appeared to Shiva and relieved him off the curse and even today in Badri there is a Brahma kapalam on account of where Brahma's 5th head was taken off Shiva's hand.Curse of Brigu Maharishi:Once when Brigu Maharishi was visiting the heavenly abodes and went to Kailasa where Shiva and Parvati were engrossed in their dance and did not pay attention to the rishi- he cursed Shiva to become a Linga. He then proceeded to Vaikunta where he stomped on the chest of Lord Srinivasa for ignoring him which is why Goddess Mahalakshmi felt insulted and left the heavenly abode. He then proceeded to Brahma where Brahma and Saraswathi were engrossed in the musical consort due to which he cursed Brahma that nobody will praise him or worship him in Bhooloka(earth) as he failed to worship and praise Brigu. But once Brahma pleaded mercy Brigu agreed to have Pushkar as the only place where Brahma will be worshiped.Curse of Saraswathi: Brahma actually had another wife by the name Bharathi. Why the need for this wife - I said to speak the vedas you need speech but first you need the intention to say them- that intention if your mind (manas) who is Bharathi. Once there was a fight between Bharathi and Saraswathi about who is greater. Bharathi says it is her because without the intention to say something one cannot speak. Saraswathi argues that it is her as even though one has intentions they are useless unless one can speak. To resolve this fight they end up in front of Brahma who ends up saying Bharathi is greater. So Saraswathi in a fit of rage curses Brahma that because he insulted speech henceforth nobody will praise him or worship him through words or speech anymore. If they want to praise him they will purely have to do it with their mind and heart. Even today before starting any of the Yagnas when one has to offer a praise to Lord Brahma they don't do it via shlokas but merely by heart. Hope this answers your question.,Madhuri Rs,https://www.quora.com/profile/Madhuri-Rs

One of the most important ancient temples in India it is situated on the banks ofthe River Alakananda in the Garhwal district of Uttarakhand. It is situated at an elevation of 10 170 feet and devotees usually walk on foot to reach the famous Badrinath temple. It is believed that the saint Adi Shankara found an idol of Lord Vishnu made of Salagrama stone in the Alakananda River. He initially enshrined the idol near the hot springs of Tapt Kund but later on the King of Garhwal re-installed the deity in the Badrinath Temple. The temple is an architectural wonder with stone facade walls and arches and a gold gilt rooftop. The designing makes the temple resemble a Buddhist vihara. Badrinath is well connected by rail road and air. The temple and its nearby areas are approachable by road. #23. Khajuraho Temple Madhya PradeshLocation: Khajuraho Madhya pradeshKnown for its beautiful sculptures and carvings the Khajuraho group of temples and monuments is located in Madhya Pradesh. The site has the largest groups of Jain and Hindu temples of the medieval era. The Khajuraho Group of Temples has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is believed to be one of the Seven Wonders of the World. It is believed that the locals in the area always knew about the temples and had maintained in the best possible way they could. It was pointed out to the British when the jungles started causing damage to the temples. The temples are grouped into the Southern Eastern and Western groups. The temple is built of sandstone and the joints have been fixed with mortise and tenon and they are held together by gravity. The most striking feature of the Khajuraho temple is the exquisitely carved set of erotic sculptures outside the temple and near the deities. #24. Kedarnath Temple UttarakhandLocation: Kedarnath UttarakhandThe Kedarnath Mandir is one of the most sacred temples in the country and is situated in the state of Uttarakhand. Flanked by the Mandakini River on one side the temple is open only from the month of April to the month of November. During the winter season the deities of the Kedarnath Temple are taken to Ukhimath and worshipped there for six months. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva who is worshipped as the Lord of the Kedar Khand. The region was known as Kedar Khand earlier. According to popular belief the temple was built by the legendary Pandavas and revived by the saint Adi Shankaracharya. The temple can be reached only through a long arduous trek from Gaurikund. The temple is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas in the country and is also one of the most important sites of the Chota Char Dham Yatra undertaken by Hindus in India. The temple has to bear the onslaught of the recent floods in Uttarakhand. Although major parts of the temple complex had to bear severe damage the Kedarnath temple has remained unharmed. . That’s it people. I will add some more if I do find it to be placed here. Being spiritual is being eternal and experiencing the bliss of solitude and peace. Try to visit one of these once in every year. You will surely find happiness in the abode of Their shrines. EDIT: Thank you Sarat Kanamarlapudi for your suggestion.

In Kali-yuga also people worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead by following various regulations of the revealed scriptures. Now kindly hear of this from me.”17 Detailed description of the Kali -yuga found in the most Purāṇas sums up to the fact that in this age people are mostly sinful fallen and do not have the necessary qualification to study the original Vedas (śruti). But everyone has a right to study āgamas and vaiṣṇava-tantras therefore such an important ingredient of the worship in the age of Kali Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra is mainly mentioned in such smṛti works. That being said we still find direct references to the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra in several śruti texts. One of the most famous examples is the Kali-santaraṇa Upaniṣad (literally “Knowledge how to cross over the Kali age”) which is the only Upaniṣad that gives the entire Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra. This minor Upaniṣad is very short – its prose text usually divided into three paragraphs equals to 13 ślokas approximately. It belongs to the Kṛṣṇa-yajur-veda and is listed in the Muktikā-canon at number 103. Its summary is as follows: at the end of the Dvāpara-yuga the great sage Nārada approached Brahmā the creator of the universe and asked him how one can overcome the evil effects of the imminent Kali-yuga. In reply to his question Brahmā said that one can do so by chanting the name of Nārāyaṇa the primordial person. While asked again which exactly names should one chant Brahmā speaks to Nārada the entire Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra: hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare hare rāma hare rāma rāma rāma hare hare iti ṣoḍaśakaṁ nāmnāṁ kali-kalmaṣa-nāśanaṁ nātaḥ parataropāyaḥ sarva-vedeṣu dṛśyate18 “These sixteen names counteract the evil effects of the Kali-yuga. After searching through all the Vedic literature one cannot find a method so sublime as the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra.” In the current editions of Kali-santaraṇa Upaniṣad however this mahā-mantra has a reversed reading with the “Hare Rāma” part coming first. There has been a minor controversy regarding this which would be impossible to conclusively resolve here because to do so one must perform a hard task of collecting and collating all the available manuscripts of the upaniṣad. Nevertheless we can at least mention several opinions regarding this. The most widely known explanation of this was expressed by Kṛṣṇadāsa Bābājī (first half of the 20th century) in his book “Śrī Mahā-mantra-vyākhyāṣṭakam”19. There he argues that since in Kali-yuga Vedic process of purification does not work and even brāhmaṇas are like śūdras then not so many people are actually eligible to read śrutis (to which Kali-santaraṇa Upaniṣad belongs) and practice mantras given therein. At the same time Purāṇas tantras and āgamas refer to the mahā-mantra as starting with “Hare Kṛṣṇa.” Understanding this Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu preached the latter version of the mahā-mantra from the āgamas thus giving everyone the benefit of its chanting and at the same time respecting the rules given in the śrutis regarding the eligibility. We may never know for sure but since there is no mention of such reversion in any authoritative source and since we have plenty of evidence that mahā -mantra starts with “Hare Kṛṣṇa” as we shall see below this explanation is not completely free from doubts. At any rate Śrī Caitanya's inversion if proven or accepted would be enough at least for the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas to consider the mantra completely perfect with the “Hare Kṛṣṇa” part first. Speaking about the order of the mahā-mantra in Kali-santaraṇa Upaniṣad Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī said: “Kali-santaraṇa Upaniṣad has been published in Mumbai and Madras but because [the manuscripts of] the upaniṣad were collected from the adulterated members of the Rāmāyet-sampradāya the order of the mahā-mantra in these particular editions was reversed. But even despite being so its meaning and position cannot be reversed. Any wise person will not accept any order or reading different from the mahā-mantra and its order given by the person denoted by the holy name (nāmi) Śrī Gaurasundara who himself descended in Kali-yuga to distribute the easy process for crossing over the age of Kali (kali-santaraṇa) and attaining love of God.”20 The ancient text of the Ananta- saṁhitā clearly corroborates the śruti evidence found in the Kali-santaraṇa Upaniṣad but more it corroborates that the mahā-mantra begins with the “Hare Kṛṣṇa” part of the mantra: hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare hare rāma hare rāma rāma rāma hare hare ṣoḍaśaitāni nāmāni dvātriṁśad varṇakāni hi kalau yuge mahā-mantraḥ sammato jīvatāraṇe tārakaṁ brahma-nāmaitad brahmaṇā guruṇādinā kali-santaraṇādyāsu śrutiṣv-adhigataṁ hareḥ prāptaṁ śrī brahma-śiṣyeṇa śrī nāradena dhīmatā nāmaitad-uttamaṁ śrauta-pāramparyeṇa brahmaṇaḥ21 “All śāstras agree that the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra which is composed of sixteen names divided into thirty-two syllables is the great mantra for delivering the jīvas in Kali-yuga. The original guru Lord Brahmā received these holy names which which deliver one from material existence from Lord Hari as described in the Kali-santaraṇa Upaniṣad and other śrutis. The intelligent sage Nārada the disciple of Lord Brahmā received these highest names by the process of hearing from a spiritual authority.” Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra’s correct order is also defined in Sanat-kumāra-saṁhitā: hare kṛṣṇau dvir āvṛttau kṛṣṇa tādṛk tathā hare hare rāma tathā rāma tathā tādṛk hare punaḥ hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare hare rāma hare rāma rāma rāma hare hare22 “The words ‘Hare Kṛṣṇa’ are to be repeated twice then ‘Kṛṣṇa’ and ‘Hare’ are to be repeated separately twice. Similarly ‘Hare Rāma’ ‘Rāma’ and ‘Hare’ are also repeated twice. The mantra will thus be – Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare. (Sanat-kumāra-saṁhitā as quoted by Dhyānacandra Gosvāmī in his Gaura-Govindārcana-smaraṇa-paddhati verses 132-133). In practice however the question of order is not of primary importance since as soon as one starts chanting the mantra such differences disappear in the incessant flow of the names. This is confirmed by A.C. Bhaktivedānta Swami Prabhupāda: “Either you chant Hare Rāma or you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa it is the same. There is no difference. Sometimes they first of all place ""Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare."" And sometimes they place ""Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa..."" There is no difference. Sometimes they say ""No it should be Hare Rāma first."" Sometimes they ... ""No Hare Kṛṣṇa."" But that is not very important childish. Any... either you say Hare Rāma or Hare Kṛṣṇa the same. So this is to be done.”23 Another śruti Caitanyopaniṣad from the Atharva-veda which was published by Kedāranātha Datta (Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura) in 1887 also refers to the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā -mantra. What appears to have been a single manuscript of this Upaniṣad was sent to Kedāranātha by a devotee named Madhusūdana Dāsa from Sambalpur Odisha24. Therein Brahmā tells Pippalāda about the upcoming advent of the Supreme Lord as Śrī Caitanya who will chant the confidential mantra of his own names: sa eva mūla-mantraṁ japati harir iti kṛṣṇa iti rāma iti “He chants a mūla-mantra consisting of the names Hari Kṛṣṇa and Rāma.” (Caitanyopaniṣad 11)25. Here Brahmā clearly alludes to the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā -mantra by mentioning three names constituting it in the nominative case. And in the following verse he again alludes to it by stating the number of names in it: nāmāny aṣṭāv aṣṭa ca śobhanāni tāni nityaṁ ye japanti dhīrās te vai māyām atitaranti nānyaḥ paramaṁ mantraṁ parama-rahasyaṁ nityam āvartayati. “These two parts of eight names each are very glorious. Those wise persons who always chant them surely cross beyond the illusion of material existence. Others do not. The liberated persons always chant this supreme mantra which is very confidential.” (Caitanyopaniṣad 14)26. References to the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra from a number of Purāṇas are quoted in the post-Caitanya works. Unfortunately not all of them can be traced to the current editions of these Purāṇas. For example Dhyānacandra Gosvāmī in his paddhati (manual for mediation and worship) quotes Padma-Purāṇa: dvātriṁśad akṣaraṁ mantraṁ nāma ṣoḍaśakānvitam prajapan vaiṣṇavo nityaṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇa-sthalaṁ labhet “A vaiṣṇava who constantly chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra composed of sixteen names divided into thirty-two syllables will certainly attain the abode of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa.” (Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇāṣṭa-kālīya-līlā-smaraṇa-krāma-paddhatiḥ 161)27. Nayanānanda Ṭhākura quotes Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa in his Kṛṣṇa-bhakti-rasa-kadamba (A.D. 1730): hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare iti japtvā pramucyeta pātakā nātra saṁśayaḥ “Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare."" “Any sinful person who chants these holy names is at once liberated. There is no doubt about it."" And Agni Purāṇa: hare rāma hare rāma rāma rāma hare hare śvapaco'pi japan nityaṁ mucyate śṛnu bhārgava28: “Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare.” “O Bhārgava! If a dog eater constantly chants these holy names he will be liberated.” (Kṛṣṇa-bhakti-rasa-kadamba chapter 6). Agni Purāṇa also states: hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare raṭanti helayā vāpi te kṛtārthā na saṁśayaḥ29 “Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare.” “Whoever chants this mantra even neglectfully will attain the supreme goal of life. Of this there is no doubt.” Rādhā-hṛdaya which is of tāntrika outlook and is said to once have been a part of Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa mentions entire Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra. In the 6th chapter there is a conversation between king Vṛsabhānu and Kratu Muni. The king after performing severe penances for many years hears a celestial voice (vāk aśārīriṇī) that instructs him to take to the chanting of Hari's names. When he asks which names exactly should he chant the demigoddess sends him to a sage named Kratu who lives nearby deeply immersed in meditation. The king approaches the sage and asks him for harināma. The sage gives him harināma-mantra and at this moment Lomaharṣaṇa Sūta interrupts Vedavyāsa's narration and requests him to repeat the mantra given by Kratu to Vṛsabhānu: yat tvayā kīrtitaṁ nātha hari-nāmeti saṁjñitam mantraṁ brahma-padaṁ siddhi-karaṁ tad vada no vibho “O powerful sage! You glorified the mantra called “hari-nāma” please instruct me in this spiritual vibration that bestows all perfection.” In reply Śrī Vedavyāsa gives the following instruction: grahaṇād yasya mantrasya dehī brahma-mayo bhavet sadyaḥ pūtaḥ surā-po ‘pi sarva-siddhi-yuto bhavet tad ahaṁ te 'bhidhāsyāmi mahā-bhāgavato hy asi hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare hare rāma hare rāma rāma rāma hare hare ity aṣṭa-śatakaṁ nāmnāṁ tri-kāla-kalmaṣāpy aham nātaḥ parataropāyaḥ sarva-vedeṣu vidyate30 “I will certainly instruct you a great devotee in that mantra by which an embodied soul can be liberated and even a drunkard can quickly become purified and attain all perfection. Hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare hare rāma hare rāma rāma rāma hare hare. By chanting this mantra one hundred and eight times thrice a day destroys all sins. In all the Vedas there is no other method for achieving liberation from material bondage.” (Rādha-hṛdaya 6.52-56). In the āgamas such as the Brahma-yāmala Lord Śiva describes the mahā-mantra as follows: hariṁ vinā nāsti kiñcit pāpa-nistārakaṁ kalau tasmāl lokoddhāraṇārthaṁ hari-nāma prakāśayet sarvatra mucyate loko mahā-pāpāt kalau yuge hare-kṛṣṇa-pada-dvandvaṁ kṛṣṇeti ca pada-dvayam tathā hare-pada-dvandvaṁ hare-rāma iti dvayam tad-ante ca mahā-devi rāma rāma dvayaṁ vadet hare hare tato brūyād dhari-nāma samuddharet mahā-mantraṁ ca kṛṣṇasya sarva-pāpa-praṇāśakam31 “Without Hari there is no other way to eradicate the sins in the age of Kali. Therefore hari-nāma should be revealed in order to save the world. The people in Kali -yuga everywhere can be liberated from the greatest sins by chanting the following mantra. First one should chant two words “Hare Kṛṣṇa” twice and then two words more - “Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa.” Then one should chant two words “Hare Hare” and then twice “Hare Rāma.” In the end Mahādevī one should chant “Rāma Rāma” and then “Hare Hare.” In this way one should pronounce the mahā-mantra of Lord Kṛṣṇa which destroys all sins.” In the Rādhā-tantra from Vāsudeva-māhātmya Vāsudeva says to Tripura Devī: śṛṇu mātar mahā-māye viśva-bīja-svarūpiṇi hari-nāmno mahāmāye krāmaṁ vada sureśvari “Listen o mother personification of Mahā-māyā and the seed of the universe! Please explain to me the sequence of the mahā-mantra.” In response to this Tripurā Devī says: hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare hare rāma hare rāma rāma rāma hare hare dvātriṁśad-akṣarāṇy evaṁ kalau nāmāni sarvadā śṛṇu cchandaḥ suta-śreṣṭha hari-nāmnaḥ sadaiva hi32 “O best among sons! These thirty-two syllables save everyone in Kali-yuga. Now please hear from me about the meter of this mantra etc.” (Rādhā-tantra 2.8-10). Some of the current editions of Purāṇas also refer to the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra: īśvara uvāca— harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam hare rāma hare kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇeti maṅgalam evaṁ vadanti ye nityaṁ na hi tān bādhate kaliḥ33 Lord Śiva said: “Kali does not harass those who only chant the holy names of Hari always or the auspicious vibrations like “Hare Rāma” “Hare Kṛṣṇa” and “Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa.” (Padma Purāṇa Pātāla-khaṇḍa 80. 2-3). hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa bhakta-vatsala gopate śaraṇya bhagavan viṣṇo māṁ pāhi bahu-saṁsṛteḥ34 Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa! O Lord who is affectionate to his devotees! O one who protects cows! O my shelter! O Lord Viṣṇu! Please protect me from the various tribulations in the material existence.” (Pātāla-khaṇḍa 19.25-26 (Puruṣottama-māhātmya)). upabhujya sa-dharmātmā svairaṁ vigata-vikriyaḥ hare rāma hare kṛṣṇa japann iti jagāma ha35 That pious person free from anxiety went away while chanting “Hare Rāma Hare Kṛṣṇa.” (Padma Purāṇa Uttara-khaṇḍa 204.108)Full article by Brijbasi Prabhu at link below.

When this happens your state of mind will start to change like that of Paramatma ie calmness loss of ego etc and there will be overflow of joy in your brain without any external stimulation. For more curious beings there is a detailed explanation on this👇Deves · Nov 10When we go deep into the meditative state we reach the state of void nothingness. What is beyond this state? Is it possible to reach a state where we can observe the creation of the void itself?I WILL KEEP UPDATING THIS ANSWER AS THERE IS TOO MUCH TO SHARE SO YOU CAN BASICALLY READ IN INSTALLMENTS😂 I will tell about my geographical culture and the way of life I was born in  Sanatan.Just be patient while reading. First you need to understand the basics of spirituality in simple and easy words which no one tells. It is said in Hinduism “parmaatma resides everywhere”. This is also true but no one exlprores why it is said. You need to understand reality. Reality is something that cannot be put into words because no one knows what reality is the moment we put reality into words is the moment reality fades away our brain perceives the word “reality” as reality .Reality is often between the words. It can only be felt and its first experience is just its visual imagination which is the gateway to reality.We read words but we do not see the gap between each word. We ignore the gap is it means nothing or “shunya” ie. “0″. The shunya is reality. Our brain always keeps thinking. But if we observe. Their is always a minute gap between the thoughts. As we shift from the thought of brushing our teeth to going to a date their is a minute gap between these 2 thoughts. That darkness and silence is the reality. But it is just the experience of 1st phase of reality. The reality is far beyond our 5 senses. We are made of material. We live in 3D world. We use only 5% of our brain. We have 64 dimensions written in vedas and we try to understand Paramatma with our 1200grams of brain living in 3rd dimension. Suppose a bacteria living in a cave it borns reproduces and dies after completing his life span. He never saw sky only saw cave walls covering him. It percieves that only area as his sky his world. He applies his minute brain and thinks he knows the reality. Same are we humans. A phone call can reach at any corner of the world and people think how can god be everywhere. We are bonded in laws of universe. We think we are doing the things but in reality universe is doing everything. We think we are lifting waits and can build body. We train and lift heavy waits we get tired.But we forget that we are bond to the universe’s law of gravity that is not allowing me to do thing that i want to do after a certain limit. We are bonded. It is a law that we will age and die no matter what and it always happens to everybody. Paramatma says He wants us to understand him in his (tatva roop)molecular form.  Paramatma says he is in you you need to find me. I am beyond your senses. When you rise above the hormonal pleasures you find paramatma. Lets take “joy” in points. Suppose if you are sitting idle your joy will be 2–3points you buy a car your joy is 6 points you have sex you joy is 15 points. But once you rise above the sexual pleasure you feel a diffrent kind of pleasure known as Paramanand which will be like 100 points. It is continous flow of joy. When you were a kid you used to think biggest joy was to play around when you grew up you think sex is biggest pleasure because you have never experienced param anand. Some people say Shiv linga means private part of shiva. But reality is upside down. We experience too much pleasure only if our private part is stimulated. Private part acquires only some area of your body. You get pleasure only through that area. But once you dive in param anand. Your whole body becomes stimutated to the core. Whole body becomes like linga. That is it to denote it.A blow of air can give you so much pleasure than your imagination. Thats why some people become Sanyasis and live their rest of life meditating because they do not seek pleasure from external material source of less points. Because you may think you are going to have a good time with you bf/gf driving a good car and look at a sadhu sitting and meditating and you laugh at them that they are missing real joy of life whereas the reality is you are chasing a 15 point pleasure with material things and the sadhu is diving into 100 points while sitting and being in reality. Sadhu feels self satisfied self lovedeuphoria words will get over but you cant write in words the real pleasure of paramanand.  Once an experiment was conducted about waves good words such as “Thankyou” produced soft and symmetrical waves on ice surface while cursed words produced irregular waves. Everything in this world is the byproduct of waves frequencies. It is written in vedas that the creation began when damru beats of lord shiva began striking and rythming ommmmm. It is personified to make us understand. Hinduism is not a religion. It is ultimate reality. It is the oldest. We say lord ganesha is an elephant like guy. But in reality lord ganesha is god of intelligence. For intelligence signs were created like brain to denote him. As it is the oldest religion. Chances are that people over generations did not read and understand scriptures that they came with this crap.  .Paramatma or Supersoul when looked at it molecular form is made of same energy which resides in every single human beings. Its never found because it is grabbed by 5 senses and material urges. You are like a sub part of supersoul bond in a hormone driven brain living in a tiny material planet at some corner of universe. When you meditate your 5 senses drops one by one any your inner soul is synced with energy of paramatma. Just like if this bottle gets the sence of body and gets driven by hormones it will never be able to know it has water inside it just like the whole sea. Now personify the bottle and make buildings and all worldly things inside the rest sea water area…you will see a new Maya World created in your imagination.  We basically live in a dream. We are part of something great but we a always live in illusion. We never feel we are bond with time and each second passing we are moving towards the “Reality” that is death. After death your senses won’t work only pure consciousness will remain. That is when you merge into reality. Sometimes many people do many wrong things like cheating on their partner killing someone raping a teenage girl and the incident never came out. Their senses make them feel do those things but each time they do something wrong the frequency of their soul goes down that is the gut feeling which your senses instantly rub under your shoe soul of ego and anger which again in influenced by hormones which is also a material in body and will docompose with the body one day.After his death his polluted soul would not be able to match its energy frequency of the supersoul which is the source of happiness. It will face a repulsion and will get stuck in lower frequency dimension personified as Nark or Hell. It is said hell because the pure consciousness or the soul is in too much depressed condition because of their deeds…but they would not have material brains to secrete bliss hormones while watching tv or having sex. It is just pure consciousness that remaines now. Which again has to get in the cycle of time and face birth and death. When you go into space from earthin your mindyou cross all the layers of atmosphere and you travel more and more to several lakhs kms you find an imaginary layer. That is the layer till where TIME works  Everything is just a work of waves. The waves produced made this world of maya. Maya world is material world away from reality. If we cut the bottle in the sea at the above figure water will merge into sea knowing its real identity and leave bottle as it was maya and material same as humans. Everything is going in a time frame. Paramatma is beyond all this. It is a pure consciousness. Everthing is happening in paramatma the maya is the part of paramatma you are a part of him too he is everywhere. He is much more greater than time. He himself created TIME which is in turn an illusion through waves. When we die we get merged in that supreme consciousness thus experiencing all dimensions and knowing “all pasts” and “all futures” because ultimately everything is happening in paramatma himself. Thats how our ancestor sadhus came to know about future and predicted future because they synced themselves with the dimension which is beyond time they matched their frequencies with that of paramatma in which every past present and future resides.   In this video you can see the monk is in param anand he is at that stage of consciousness where he identifies himself as God (Soul) and the level of pleasure is bigger than the pain of burning to death for him. When we meditate we basically see an inside dark world of silence. We gradually dive deeper and deeper to our consciousness. We start by meditating we feel our brain so crowded because of negative thoughts in reality those thoughts are not coming but going away from your mind thats why you see slideshow of some negative moments when you meditate. As your thoughts keep going out you dive deeper from conscious brain to subconscious brain and ultimalely with extensive practice you reach to a consciousness of our non material or molecular body. When you reach there the supersoul energy that is all around you will began syncing with your soul energy and you will lose the sense of body. You will feel satisfied complete within yourself. You don’t need any external stimulation for pleasure. You are always in joy now because now you know you are one with Paramatma. No fear can defeat you like the burning monk above no body can threat you no one will be at your level in life. Paramatma contains everything you can imagine and things that you can not imagine. If your mind is pure with meditation and you have gratefullness paramatma takes a form of which ever idol you worship with same pure state of mind. He only sees your intensions he loves you and will form any “form” that you worship him because all Brahma Vishnu and Mahesh have different roles because they constitute different dimensionsbut at the molecular level they are all inside paramatma. Paramatma has no face no colour he is everywhere you just don’t have to apply logic and senses to experience him. He is unimaginable you can never imagine Paramatma who constitutes all dimensions all time frame all pasts all future everything with a 3rd dimensional hormonal brain that is not even as big comapred to earth i guess? He is anant he is shiv he is denoted by Shiv Linga as it has no shape. It is neither round nor cylindrical neitger square neither rectangle or cone.,Deves,https://www.quora.com/profile/Deves-1

TheContinue ReadingManagement of temple should spend donated wealth to help the poor Lack of discrimination is the greatest sin in view of God. The extent of the determination to sacrifice wealth for the sake of God is one important angle. Another important angle is the recognition of human form of God who enjoys your sacrifice. You might have reached the climax of the first angle. In such case you sacrifice your wealth to temples but not to human incarnation which will be properly utilized by Him. The wealth sacrificed by you to the temples is not properly utilized by the people of management of the temple. They distribute the food among all the devotees who visit the temple. Such sacrifice is totally waste. You must differentiate the poor devotees and help them by such donated wealth. You can help even an atheist who is a poor person. If the atheist becomes free of the worries of the poverty he will have peaceful mind to think about God and in course of time he may become a great devotee of God. You are helping him by providing a chance to become the devotee of God. Therefore the management of temple should spend the devoted wealth to help the poor people and not to help the rich devotees who are not in need. The service is being done to all the devotees irrespective of their need. This lack of discrimination is the greatest sin in view of God. Therefore the donor himself should do such service by spending some time in such important effort. This will be far better than the blind donation to some agency which itself is blind. You must help the poor people irrespective of their devotion because even an atheist has chance to become a devotee after becoming peaceful in mind. Practice is equally important The extent of the determination to sacrifice wealth for the sake of God is one important angle. Another important angle is the recognition of human form of God who enjoys your sacrifice. The people who are not matured in either of these two angles neither like the sacrifice nor like the recognition of human incarnation. They become very intelligent and like to have the fruit of sacrifice of both the angles through their clever interpretation. They treat the statue or photo as God. They sacrifice the food to God represented by photo or statue and eat it. They claim to achieve the fruit of the devotee sacrificing the food to human incarnation. Statues and photos are the results of the clever interpretations of such selfish people only. If such angle is not present in the mind the offer of food to the statues and photos is not at all wrong because such sacrifice develops at least the theoretical devotion in the beginners. Theory is the mother of practice. Without theory there is no birth of practice. But the theory without practice is a waste in the long run and does not yield even a trace of the fruit at anytime. The knowledge and devotion are the two parts of the theory. You may have lot of information about Delhi and its path and you many have a lot of inspiration also to go to Delhi. Both these are knowledge and devotion respectively. Without putting even a little effort like going to the railway station to purchase the ticket there is no use of the knowledge and the devotion. Theory is very important because it is the generator of the practice. But practice is equally important since there will be no generation of even a trace of fruit without practice. Therefore the theory involving jnana yoga (knowledge) and bhakti yoga (devotion) along with karma yoga (practice) are equally needed for achieving the grace of God.,Shri Datta,https://www.quora.com/profile/Shri-Datta-6

Upon seeing them Duryodhana tells them that he wants to gift the Hastinapur Kingdom and Crown to Pandavas. Yudhistir rejects this saying Hastinapur is not Duryodhan’s to gift. He instead offers Duryodhana to pick one of the Pandavas for a one-on-one fight with the weapon of his choice. It is a known fact that Duryodhana is very good with mace and would have easily defeated Yudhistir Arjuna Nakula and Sahadeva. But he prefers to fight his arch-nemesis Bheema who is the one who can match him in a duel with Mace.Despite Bhima's physical advantage Duryodhana had the better technique due to his devotion to his craft (This is why Balarama likes Duryodhana more than Bheema who taught both of them the craft of Mace fighting). After a long and brutal battle between the two disciples of Balarama Duryodhana begins to exhaust Bhima and nearly makes Bhima faint.Krishna who had been observing the duel signals to Bheema repeatedly clapping his own thigh. This is a clear violation of the mace fighting but Bheema who is now reminded of the oath he had taken after the game of dice to crush Duryodhana’s thighs starts attacking Duryodhana’s thighs mortally injuring him.Duryodhana bemoans that he was slain by unfair means given that it was illegal to attack below the waist. He curses Krishna for his deceitful tricks and Pandavas for openly flouting the rules of war.Balarama is enraged after knowing that Bheema broke the rules of Mace fight to kill and raises his weapon in attack. Lord Krishna consoles Balarama by reminding him of Duryodhana's evil deeds. Relenting but fuming Balarama curses Bheema to be known in the world as a crooked warrior and blesses Duryodhana with glory naming Duryodhana his greatest pupil.Source: Duryodhana #duryodhana - DeviantArt Google Images,Suryateja Rokkam,https://www.quora.com/profile/Suryateja-Rokkam-1

Who is considered God in Advaita Vedanta?,https://www.quora.com/Who-is-considered-God-in-Advaita-Vedanta,,In Advaita Vedanta God is never an object! When God is not an object the question of description does not arise. How can we describe something that is not an object? God is not something that is perceived by our senses. God is not something that can be imagined! Is it possible for any animal to imagine the concept of a religion or a creator? Is it ever possible for a computer to visualize its creator? The human being is always curious to know God and in the bargain falls into the grip of dogmas. Advaita Vedanta says “Instead of looking for God outside as an object sit quietly and introspect. Who is this person introspecting?” This introspecting subject is like a salt doll which jumped in to gauge the depth of ocean but never surfaced again to declare the ocean’s depth. ‘Realizing -God’ is not a process to be undertaken. The state of the ‘wholesale emptying’ of everything that this physical body/mind with its five senses has acquired as conditioning during its life on this earth is a prerequisite to realize this subject ‘God’. God is a subjective state devoid of any sensory memory! It is the very existence of the seeker and consciousness of this existence. Consciousness-Existence is the ultimate substratum which forms the backdrop of this moving universe. This unmoving stable backdrop is indeed ‘YOU’ the ultimate “I” consciousness that appears as soon as we wake up from a deep slumber. Consciousness-Existence devoid of any externality is ‘God’ if you insist on the name ‘God’. Otherwise strictly speaking you are not there to utter the word ‘God’ when you are already ‘God’!

Who judges a Hindu? How is he/she judged after death?,https://www.quora.com/Who-judges-a-Hindu-How-is-he-she-judged-after-death,,There are two major views of the afterlife in Hinduism. The mythical and the philosophical. Huge topic but I shall be as brief as possible. Firstly the Philosophical - each individual consists of 3 bodies: physical body comprise of 70% water and some bio-matter (sthūla śarīra) an energetic/psychic/mental/subtle body (sūkṣma-śarīra) and a causal body (kāraṇa śarīra) comprising all our subliminal stuff i.e. mental impressions etc. Thus the individual is a stream of consciousness which flows through all the physical changes of the body and at the death of the physical body flows on into another physical body. The two components that transmigrate are the subtle body and the causal body. The thought that occupies the mind at the time of death determines the quality of our rebirth (antim smaraṇa) _ hence the need to be mindful of our thoughts and the need to cultivate positive wholesome thoughts - mantra chanting is an aid to this. The Mythical - includes the philosophical but adds colour panache and dramatic narrative and effect. When we leave the physical body at death we appear in the court of Lord Yama the God of Death for an exit interview. The panel consists of Yama and Chitragupta - the cosmic accountant and Varuna the cosmic intelligence officer. We are counseled about our life achievements and failures and are shown a mirror in which our entire life is reflected. (Important to note that philosophically these three gentlemen are projections of our own mind.) Yama the Lord of Dharma and Justice then sends us to a heavenly holiday realm (svarga) if we have been exceptionally benevolent and beneficent for a period of Rest and Recreation. Our vacation is limited in time by the weight of our good deeds. If we have been exceptionally malevolent and caused immense suffering to other beings then we are sent to a cosmic gulag (naraka) to fast-track our negative Karma - again limited by the enormity of our wickedness. The vast majority of people are neither very good or very wicked - they are mediocre so they take rebirth almost immediately according to Karma. Very important to note neither heaven nor hell are permanent states in Hindu Jain and Buddhist belief systems. After we have exhausted our benevolence and malevolence we take birth again to continue our spiritual evolution. Rebirth can take place as a god (deva) a human (manuṣya) an animal (tiryak) — but it is generally taught that the spiritual evolution takes place from lower to highers species. In certain cases of traumatic death a person can take the form of a Preta or Hungry Ghost - and remains in an earth-bound state interminably - until certain ceremonies are done to liberate them. This the the annual Sarva Pitru Amavasya ceremony that is done.,Rami Sivan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Rami-Sivan

People think it because the same word is used as gender identifying symbol in Sanskrit. The word ‘lingam’ in Sanskrit means symbol. So how did it become phallus? In Sanskrit all the words are perfectly made with root words (dhatu) and ending parts (Pratyay). Generally the Pratyays don't have any meaning as they are only the ending parts not the main word. But some Pratyays have symbolic meaning or indicates something or someone they are the ‘linga Pratyay’ or in short ‘linga’ those ending part of the words that have meaning. These symbols are of different types as - Purush Pratyay Stri Pratyay and others. These Pratyays or symbols are added to the ending part of words to identify the person is male female or neutar gender. And by time people made such mistakes. If it was Phallus then how could the word Stri linga come for indicating female gender? What does the scriptures say about Lingam? The Linga Purana one of the 18 Mahapurana in its Third Chapter says that ""The formless Supreme being(Brahma or Brahman) is Lingam. Mahadev is that Supreme being formless and Nirguna form him all the Indescribable things appeared. The greatest lingam holds two parts - the Pradhana (principal) and the Prakriti (nature). The foremost lingam is devoid of colour test touch smell and vibration or sound truly Shiva is alinga(formless or without symbol). Again he himself are the Pancha Bhutas Pancha Tamnatras taking the form of the lingam. And from this lingam the cause of this creation Vishnu Brahma and Shiva arose."" In the 129th suktam (Nasadiya Suktam) of the 10th Mandal of Rigveda ""In the beginning of the creation there was nothing. Ishwara was there only as the soul (Atma or Atman) without any symbol. There arose desire in His mind and from that everything was created.""It means everything was concentrated in a place at first. In the same Suktam of 10th Mandal of Rigveda it is said that the lingam at first started spreading up and down (which shows that the concentrated thing then took the shape of a cosmic pillar) then to its sides.It is also said in the Lingodbhava Chapter of Linga/Shiva Purana. Yogasikha Upanishad says ""This lingam is itself the creator and the creation."" If you carefully observe the Shiva lingam then you will surely fond two sets of stages on which the main Lingam stands. Why are the stages present under the lingam? What is there importance? The answer is right beside the Lingam itself it is the 'Trishul' (trident) of Shiva which indicates three qualities of the World- 1. Satwa 2. Raja and 3. Tama. These three gunas or qualities form the lingam from the base as-  1. The base or Bhumi bhag- It is the Satwik part where Lord Brahma resides. It shows the peace that remain when one is remaining under the shade of God following him in every steps of life. 2. The upper stage or Pitham- It is the container of the God with Raja guna i.e. Lord Vishnu. Vishnu remaining here holds the Supreme being above and protects the creator and creation under. The stage contains a drainage system which shows the characteristics of Lord Vishnu as a provider of Moksha (eternal salvation). Here the water indicates the life and flow of water indicates the following of the path of God helps one attaining Moksha. These two parts are togetherly is the 'Prakriti bhag'. It is the part indicating Mother Durga who is the better half of Shiva. It indicates our mother nature holds us in her. 3. The Rudra bhag- It is the Tamasik part where the Purusha (the Supreme being) resides. Linga Purana says that Shiva remains in this part in samadhi or the highest stage of meditation as the most peaceful Sambhu.Atharvaveda mentions about this part as the cosmic pillar where the Paramatma is worshipped. The Trident of Shiva are these three Gods who are unitedly the Supreme being or Paramatma. And the drum (damru) shows the cosmic vibration which helped in the creation. The lingam is also an example of the Yoga shastra. The lingam indicates the the 'Sushumna' the sensational of the living beings. The 'Ira' and 'Pingala' are indicated by the snake which rise above the lingam coiling it 3 and a half times. In the Shiva lingam the seven chakras of kundalini remains fully active. And so it is the most powerful thing which makes a person spiritually awaken and brings peace in mind.[If you need proof then go to a Shiva Temple which is soundless and without doing anything just sit before the lingam. You can feel it by yourself.] In the end if we co relate the stort of Nrisingha Purana then we find that Lord Vishnu also came out of a pillar to save the human civilization. It indicates all the Gods are residing together in the Shiva lingam. The Lingam is the corporeal form of the formless Ishwara. How? It is the form of Shiva in which the form of Shiva is remained incorporeal but it contains form of a pillar. So here God is both corporeal and formless being. And the 'Tripundra' drawn indicates the heaven the earth and the hell all are from him.So if you understand all these then you can surely understand that the whole world is the lingam and the great saying of Skanda Purana ""Even the sky is a lingam"" The Shiva lingam present in the temples are nothing but the activated form of the main lingam where Shiva is surely present and active.",Pallab Sen,https://www.quora.com/profile/%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%B2%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%AC-%E0%A6%B8%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%A8-Pallab-Sen

Is it true that the Quran contradicts itself?,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-the-Quran-contradicts-itself?no_redirect=1,,"———————————This answer is so long ———————————- First let me tell you that i didn’t want to answer this question because i don’t like encouraging people taking their information from anti-Islam sources. I will address the points he mentioned one-by-one : (Statements in Bold are the claims) (Do not they consider the Quran (with care)? Had it been from other than Allah they would surely have found therein much discrepancy) - Surah 4 verse 82There are several problems with this verse first it says if the Quran had been from someone other than Allah we would have found much discrepancy in it. So if a book is written by anyone other than Allah it will be filled with discrepancies but this is just silly!Answer : Yeah this is silly. You see what he did here? he made a straw-man argument. Allah didn’t say “if a book is written by anyone..etc” Allah talks about the Quran specifically. Allah didn’t say (Do not they consider any book (with care)? Had it been from other than Allah they would surely have found therein much discrepancy) rather he said (Do not they consider the Quran (with care)? Had it been from other than Allah they would surely have found therein much discrepancy).Why would we have to find much discrepancy in a book to know that it’s not from Allah? why not some discrepancy or little discrepancy? It’s as if the Quran is saying you might find a few errors and contradictions in the Quran but you know it’s the word of Allah as you don’t find much discrepancy.Answer : Again a straw-man argument. Allah didn’t say you have to find much discrepancy in the Quran and if you find a little it’s OK !!! What’s the main point here? the creator whether its God or anyone else. Allah tells us if someone made the Quran other than Allah people would have discovered plenty of errors in it. He didn’t mention that the Quran contains some errors!! where did this man get that from?. If anyone brought me a single verse stating that i will leave Islam immediately because i will be convinced that it’s not from God. This man twists the verses and then try to criticize them.How long did it take Allah to create the universe? according to Surah 7 verse 54 it took 6 days. According to Surah 41 verses 9–12 it took 8 days.Answer : I can’t believe that there are still people who stir these topics after they were made clear over and over again. I will answer them nonetheless. He says there are contradiction between Surah 7 and Surah 41. I will quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 7 verse 54 : “Indeed your Lord is Allah who created the heavens and earth in six days and then established Himself above the Throne. He covers the night with the day [another night] chasing it rapidly; and [He created] the sun the moon and the stars subjected by His command. Unquestionably His is the creation and the command; blessed is Allah Lord of the worlds.” Surah 41 verses 9–12 : “Say ""Do you indeed disbelieve in He who created the earth in two days and attribute to Him equals? That is the Lord of the worlds ۞ And He placed on the earth firmly set mountains over its surface and He blessed it and determined therein its [creatures'] sustenance in four days without distinction - for [the information] of those who ask ۞ Then He directed Himself to the heaven while it was smoke and said to it and to the earth ""Come [into being] willingly or by compulsion."" They said ""We have come willingly ۞ And He completed them as seven heavens within two days and inspired in each heaven its command. And We adorned the nearest heaven with lamps and as protection. That is the determination of the Exalted in Might the Knowing.” There is no contradiction between the time period mentioned in these verses and the other verse which says that it was six days. In these verses – from Surah 41 – we see that Allah is telling us that He “created the earth in two Days”. Then He “placed therein (i.e. the earth) firm mountains from above it and He blessed it and measured therein its sustenance (for its dwellers)” in four days equal– i.e. in two days that were added to the two days in which He created the earth so the total is four days. It does not say that the creation of the mountains and the measuring of the sustenance took four days. Perhaps the confusion which is mentioned in the question stems from this i.e. from thinking that the four days are added to the two days in which the earth was created equaling six and then adding the two days in which the heavens were created (“Then He completed and finished from their creation (as) seven heavens in two Days”) – making a total of eight days not six days. But this confusion can be dispelled by dealing with this mistaken notion. So the earth was created in two days and the mountains were created and the sustenance measured in two more days which makes a total of four i.e. this took the other two days. Then the creation of the seven heavens took two days. So the total is six days of the Days of Allah may He be glorified and exalted. (not like ordinary days) The interpreters commented on this fact which deals with the mistaken notion. Imam Al-Qurtubi said: “in four days” – this is like someone saying “I set out from Basra to Baghdad in ten days and to Kufa in fifteen days i.e. a total time of fifteen days.” (al-Jaami’ li Ahkaam al-Qur’aan vol. 15 p. 343). Imam Al-Baghawi said: “in four days” means the creation of what is in the earth. The measuring of the sustenance was on Tuesday and Wednesday which along with Sunday and Monday add up to four days. This is like saying “I married a woman yesterday and today I married two” – one of whom is the woman whom he married the day before. (Tafseer al-Baghawi 7/165 ) Imam Al-Zajjaaj said: “in four days” means two days added to the previous two days. (Al-Kashshaaf vol. 3 p. 444) These verses – from Surah 41 – confirm the other verse which says that the creation of the heavens and the earth was completed in six days. So there is no contradiction concerning the period in which Allah created the heavens and the earth. There cannot be any such contradictions in the Quran.What did Allah create first the heavens or the earth? According to Surah 2 verse 29 the earth was created first then the heavens. According to Surah 79 verses 27–30 the heavens were created first then the earth.Answer : I will quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 2 verse 29 : “It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth. Then He directed Himself to the heaven [His being above all creation] and made them seven heavens and He is Knowing of all things” Surah 79 verses 27–30 : “Are you a more difficult creation or is the heaven? Allah constructed it ۞ He raised its ceiling and proportioned it ۞ And He darkened its night and extracted its brightness ۞ And after that He spread the earth.” So the earth was created first not spread then the heaven was created then the earth was spread by bringing forth water and pasture from it i.e. trees crops and so on. What is meant by the words of Allah may He be exalted “He it is Who created for you all that is on earth” [Surah 2 verse 239] is the earth itself and He measured out what would be upon it of provision and other things. The word “khalaqa” (translated as created) here means measured. This is in accordance with the words in Surah 41: “and measured [qaddara] therein its sustenance” [Surah 41 verse 10]. Imam Muhammad al-Ameen ash-Shinqeeti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: First of all it should be understood that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) was asked about reconciling between the verse in Surah 41 and the verse in Surah 79 and he responded by saying that Allah may He be exalted created the earth first before the heaven but it was not spread. Then He rose over towards the heaven and fashioned it as seven heavens in two days then He spread the earth after that and placed in it mountains rivers and so on. So the creation of the earth itself came before the creation of the heavens and then came the spreading of the earth with its mountains trees and so on after the creation of the heavens. This is indicated by the fact that He says: “And after that He spread the earth” [Surah 79 verse 30] and He did not say that He created it. Then He explained what is meant by spreading it by saying: “And brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture” [Surah 79 verse 31 which he didn’t mention intentionally]. The way in which Ibn ‘Abbaas reconciled between these two verses is clear and there is no problem with it as may be understood from the apparent meaning of the Holy Quran. End quote. Then he mentioned the verse in Surah 2 and explained that what is meant by creation there is measuring or creating the earth itself. He also mentioned another way of reconciling between the verses which is that the verse “And after that He spread the earth” [Surah 79 verse 30] means with that So the word ba‘d (translated here as “after”) may mean ma‘a “with”. This reconciliation may be supported by an odd mode of recitation according to which Mujaahid recited it as wa’l-arda ma‘a dhalika dahaahaa [instead of wa’l-arda ba‘da dhalika dahaahaa]. Based on this mode of recitation the verse in Surah 79 does not mention the order in which the heavens and the earth were created therefore there is no contradiction between it and the verses in Surah 2 and and Surah 41. See: Daf‘ Eehaam al-Idtiraab ‘an Aayaat al-Kitaab by al-‘Allaamah Muhammad al-Ameen ash-Shinqeeti printed with his tafseer Adwa’ al-Bayaan (10/16-18).Who was the first Muslim? In Surah 6 verse 14 it’s Muahmmed “Peace be upon him”. Surah 7 verse 143 it’s Moses “Peace be upon him”. Yet the Quran also claims that Adam “Peace be upon him” and Abraham “Peace be upon him” were Muslims.Answer : Let’s start with Etymology first; Islam (Arabic: إسلام‎ is a verbal noun originating from the triliteral root (S-L-M) which forms a large class of words mostly relating to concepts of wholeness submission safeness and peace. In a religious context it means ""voluntary submission to God"". Islām is the verbal noun of Form IV of the root and means ""submission"" or ""surrender"". Muslim the word for an adherent of Islam is the active participle of the same verb form and means ""submitter"" or ""one who surrenders"". The word sometimes has distinct connotations in its various occurrences in the Quran. In some verses there is stress on the quality of Islam as an internal spiritual state: ""Whomsoever God desires to guide He opens his heart to Islam."" Quran 6:125 Quran 61:7 Quran 39:22 Other verses connect Islam and religion (dīn) together: ""Today I have perfected your religion (dīn) for you; I have completed My blessing upon you; I have approved Islam for your religion."" Quran 5:3 Quran 3:19 Quran 3:83 Still others describe Islam as an action of returning to God—more than just a verbal affirmation of faith. In the Hadith of Gabriel islām is presented as one part of a triad that also includes imān (faith) and ihsān (excellence). Now let’s quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 6 verse 14 : “Say ""Is it other than Allah I should take as a protector Creator of the heavens and the earth while it is He who feeds and is not fed?"" Say [O Muhammad] ""Indeed I have been commanded to be the first [among you] who submit [to Allah ] and [was commanded] 'Do not ever be of the polytheists” Surah 7 verse 143 : “And when Moses arrived at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him he said ""My Lord show me [Yourself] that I may look at You."" [ Allah ] said ""You will not see Me but look at the mountain; if it should remain in place then you will see Me."" But when his Lord appeared to the mountain He rendered it level and Moses fell unconscious. And when he awoke he said ""Exalted are You! I have repented to You and I am the first of the believers.” I am very happy that he mentioned these two verses in particular. In Surah 6 the word is “Awwala Mn Aslama” which means the first one to submit to God. Whereas in Surah 7 it’s “Awwala Al-Mu’meneen” → The first of the believers (not a Muslim as following the religion of Islam). A complete lie !First Prophet in Arabia? In Surah 2 verses 125–129 It’s Abraham “Peace be upon him” and Ishmael “Peace be upon him” when they built the Kaa’ba. Yet in Surah 28 verse 46 it claims that Muhammed “Peace be upon him” was the first messenger to come to the Arabs.Answer : I will quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 2 verses 125–129 : “And [mention] when We made the House a place of return for the people and [a place of] security. And take [O believers] from the standing place of Abraham a place of prayer. And We charged Abraham and Ishmael [saying] ""Purify My House for those who perform Tawaf and those who are staying [there] for worship and those who bow and prostrate [in prayer] ۞ And [mention] when Abraham said ""My Lord make this a secure city and provide its people with fruits - whoever of them believes in Allah and the Last Day."" [ Allah ] said. ""And whoever disbelieves - I will grant him enjoyment for a little; then I will force him to the punishment of the Fire and wretched is the destination ۞ And [mention] when Abraham was raising the foundations of the House and [with him] Ishmael [saying] ""Our Lord accept [this] from us. Indeed You are the Hearing the Knowing ۞ Our Lord and make us Muslims [in submission] to You and from our descendants a Muslim nation [in submission] to You. And show us our rites and accept our repentance. Indeed You are the Accepting of repentance the Merciful ۞ Our Lord and send among them a messenger from themselves who will recite to them Your verses and teach them the Book and wisdom and purify them. Indeed You are the Exalted in Might the Wise” Surah 28 verse 46 : “And you were not at the side of the mount when We called [Moses] but [were sent] as a mercy from your Lord to warn a people to whom no warner had come before you that they might be reminded” Now the answer lies exactly in these two examples he cited. When we check the last verse of the first example (i.e. Surah 2 verse 129) we find that both Abraham “Peace be upon him” and Ishmael “Peace be upon him” were asking God to send a messenger for these people “i.e. the Arabs” from their own as stated clearly : “Our Lord and send among them a messenger from themselves who will recite to them Your verses and teach them the Book and wisdom and purify them. Indeed You are the Exalted in Might the Wise”. The other thing is that both Abraham “Peace be upon him” and Ishmael “Peace be upon him” were there in Arabia not for preaching but for building the Kaaba also as stated clearly. I wait for him to provide one verse in the whole Quran where God tells us that Abraham “peace be upon him” or Ishmael “peace be upon him” were messengers to the Arabs.According to Surah 4 verse 28 committing Shirk* (i.e. association with God in worship) is unforgivable. Later in the Same Surah 4 verse 153 Allah forgives people for committing Shirk.Answer : I will quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 4 verse 48 : “Indeed Allah does not forgive association with Him but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allah has certainly fabricated a tremendous sin” Surah 4 verse 153 : “The People of the Scripture ask you to bring down to them a book from the heaven. But they had asked of Moses [even] greater than that and said ""Show us Allah outright"" so the thunderbolt struck them for their wrongdoing. Then they took the calf [for worship] after clear evidences had come to them and We pardoned that. And We gave Moses a clear authority” There is something very important this man doesn’t mention deliberately; There is a clear distinction between dying while you worship someone with God and refusing his signs to you and repenting before you die and returning to the one true God with no association with anyone or anything else. He needs to study more “Aqida” or Islamic Creed. How to make sure that God means that? Let’s cite this part from another Surah and see : Surah 7 verses 148 - 153 : “And the people of Moses made after [his departure] from their ornaments a calf - an image having a lowing sound. Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to a way? They took it [for worship] and they were wrongdoers ۞ And when regret overcame them and they saw that they had gone astray they said ""If our Lord does not have mercy upon us and forgive us we will surely be among the losers ۞ And when Moses returned to his people angry and grieved he said ""How wretched is that by which you have replaced me after [my departure]. Were you impatient over the matter of your Lord?"" And he threw down the tablets and seized his brother by [the hair of] his head pulling him toward him. [Aaron] said ""O son of my mother indeed the people oppressed me and were about to kill me so let not the enemies rejoice over me and do not place me among the wrongdoing people ۞ [Moses] said ""My Lord forgive me and my brother and admit us into Your mercy for You are the most merciful of the merciful ۞ Indeed those who took the calf [for worship] will obtain anger from their Lord and humiliation in the life of this world and thus do We recompense the inventors [of falsehood] ۞ But those who committed misdeeds and then repented after them and believed - indeed your Lord thereafter is Forgiving and Merciful” Do you see? What if they died in disbelieve or in Shirk?The answer is in Surah 2 verses 161–162 : “Indeed those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers - upon them will be the curse of Allah and of the angels and the people all together ۞ Abiding eternally therein. The punishment will not be lightened for them nor will they be reprieved”Quran in pure Arabic. Surah 16 verse 103 tells us that the Quran is written in pure Arabic. And yet there are many foreign words in the Quran.Answer : Where are the examples of those “foreign words”? he didn’t mention any!!Surah 2 verse 62 Says that Jews and Christians don’t need to fear because we will be accepted by Allah. Surah 3 verse 85 says that the only religion accepted by Allah is Islam.Answer : I will quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 2 verse 62 : “Indeed those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans [before Prophet Muhammad] - those [among them] who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteousness - will have their reward with their Lord and no fear will there be concerning them nor will they grieve.” Surah 3 verse 85 : “And whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him and he in the Hereafter will be among the losers” In order to understand these verses correctly we need to refer to the scholars of Tafseer (Qur’anic commentary). The great Imaam Ismaa’eel ibn Katheer may Allah have mercy on him said in his tafseer of the verse from Surah 2: “Allah may He be exalted points out that whoever of the previous nations did well and was obedient will have a good reward and this will be the case for everyone who follows the Unlettered Prophet [Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) until the Hour comes – he will have eternal happiness and they will not fear what they are going to face nor will they grieve for what they have left behind. As Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘No doubt! Verily the awliya’ of Allah [i.e. those who believe in the Oneness of Allah and fear Allah much and love Allah much] no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve.’ [Surah 10 verse 62]. And Allah tells us what the angels say to the believers at the time of death (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Verily those who say “Our Lord is Allah” then they istaqaamu [stood straight i.e. truly followed Islam] on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): “Fear not nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised!”’ [Surah 41 verse 30] As far as the Jews are concerning their faith meant believing in the Tawraat (original Torah) and following the way of Moses (peace be upon him) until ‘Eesa “i.e. Jesus” (peace be upon him) - came after which whoever continued to follow the Torah and the way of Moses and did not leave this and follow Jesus was doomed. As far as the Christians are concerned their faith meant believing in the Injeel (original Gospel) and following the laws of Jesus (peace be upon him); whoever did this was a believer whose faith was acceptable to Allah until Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came after which whoever did not follow Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and leave the way of Jesus (peace be upon him) and the Gospel that he had been following before was doomed. The verse (interpretation of the meaning) “And whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him and he in the Hereafter will be among the losers” [Surah 3 verse 85] is a statement that Allah will not accept any way or deed from anyone after sending His Final Messenger except those that are in accordance with the laws of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Prior to this however anyone who followed the Prophet of his own time was on the Straight Path of salvation. So the Jews were those who followed Moses (peace be upon him) and referred to the Torah for judgement at that time. When Allah sent Jesus (peace be upon him) the Children of Israel were obliged to follow him and obey him and so they and others who followed him became Christians.. When Allaah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as the Final Prophet and a Messenger to all the children of Adam all of mankind was obliged to believe in him and obey him and refrain from what he prohibited. Those who did so are the true believers. The ummah (nation) of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) are called the believers because of their deep eemaan (faith) and conviction and because they believe in all the past Prophets and in the prophesied events that are yet to come.” Commenting on the verse in Surah 2 verse 62 “Indeed those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans [before Prophet Muhammad] - those [among them] who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteousness - will have their reward with their Lord and no fear will there be concerning them nor will they grieve.” Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “What is meant is that every group believed in Allah and the Last Day which is the appointed Day of Reckoning and did righteous deeds. But after Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sent to both mankind and the jinn true belief can only be in accordance with the way of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Whoever follows his way will not fear the future or grieve for what they leave behind.” I guess it’s pretty obvious in the verse itself when God says “Indeed those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans [before Prophet Muhammad] - those [among them] who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteousness - will have their reward with their Lord and no fear will there be concerning them nor will they grieve.”. Do Christians and Jews believe in Allah now? They curse him!What is man created from? Surah 19 verse 67 says that man was created from nothing. Surah 96 verse 2 Says that man was created from a clot of blood. Surah 21 verse 30 Says that man was created from water. Surah 16 verse 4 Says that man was created from small seed. Surah 15 verse 26 Says that man was created from Clay and Mud. Surah 3 verse 59 Says that man was created from Dust. Surah 11 verse 61 Says that man was created from Earth.Answer : I will quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 19 verse 67 : “Does man not remember that We created him before while he was nothing?” Surah 96 verse 2 : “Created man from a clinging substance (i.e. clot)” Surah 21 verse 30 : “Have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity and We separated them and made from water every living thing? Then will they not believe?” Surah 16 verse 4 : “He created man from a sperm-drop; then at once he is a clear adversary” Surah 15 verse 26 : “And We did certainly create man out of clay from an altered black mud” Surah 3 verse 59 : “Indeed the example of Jesus to Allah is like that of Adam. He created Him from dust; then He said to him ""Be"" and he was” Surah 11 verse 61 : “And to Thamud [We sent] their brother Salih. He said ""O my people worship Allah ; you have no deity other than Him. He has produced you from the earth and settled you in it so ask forgiveness of Him and then repent to Him. Indeed my Lord is near and responsive” From all the points he stirred i guess this one is the most stupid one till now. (Mud is in earth and Mud = Dust + Water. This is the origin of the creation then the progeny comes from sperm which starts to form a clot..etc) where is the contradiction here? Not to mention his poor quoting skills. Instead of Sperm he calls it “small seed”!!? Instead of saying (We created him before while he was nothing?) he says (Created from nothing) as if nothing is the building block of humans !! I will quote a verse he didn’t quote because it explains the creation of a baby in his mother’s womb : Surah 23 verses 12–14 “And certainly did We create man from an extract of clay ۞ Then We placed him as a sperm-drop in a firm lodging ۞ Then We made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot and We made the clot into a lump [of flesh] and We made [from] the lump bones and We covered the bones with flesh; then We developed him into another creation. So blessed is Allah the best of creators” As for the creation of Adam “Peace be upon him”. Surah 38 verse 71 “[So mention] when your Lord said to the angels ""Indeed I am going to create a human being from clay” As you can see no contradiction just more details in some verses.Will intercession be possible in the day of judgemen? According to Surah 20 verse 109 Surah 34 verse 23 and Surah 43 verse 86 → Yes. According to Surah 2 verse 123 Surah 6 verse 51 and Surah 82 verse 19 —-> No.Answer : I will quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 20 verse 109 : “That Day no intercession will benefit except [that of] one to whom the Most Merciful has given permission and has accepted his word” Surah 34 verse 23 : “And intercession does not benefit with Him except for one whom He permits. [And those wait] until when terror is removed from their hearts they will say [to one another] ""What has your Lord said?"" They will say ""The truth."" And He is the Most High the Grand” Surah 43 verse 86 : “And those they invoke besides Him do not possess [power of] intercession; but only those who testify to the truth [can benefit] and they know” Surah 2 verse 123 : “And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all and no compensation will be accepted from it nor will any intercession benefit it nor will they be aided” Surah 6 verse 51 : “And warn by the Qur'an those who fear that they will be gathered before their Lord - for them besides Him will be no protector and no intercessor - that they might become righteous” Surah 82 verse 19 : “It is the Day when a soul will not possess for another soul [power to do] a thing; and the command that Day is [entirely] with Allah” In Islam Intercession is accepted from Muslims only. And Good Muslims in particular who reached high degrees of piety. Intercession will be for Muslims in Hellfire in order to ask God to get them out of it. Non-believers will not be granted the right to intercede or will they benefit from intercession at all. Where is the contradiction here? (Believer → Intercession / Non-believer → No intercession) It’s quite simple. In the first 3 examples (i.e. verses) God tells us that no one will be able to intercede except those who God approves. I will detail the second 3 verses which he claims denying intercession at all : Surah 2 verse 123: Here God is talking to the Children of Israel (not to mankind in general). We can know that from the previous verse 122 : “O Children of Israel remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the worlds” So to read them together : “O Children of Israel remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the worlds ۞ And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all and no compensation will be accepted from it nor will any intercession benefit it nor will they be aided” Surah 2 verses 122–123 Surah 6 verse 51: Here God tells the Prophet (peace be upon him) to warn the people and incite them to be righteous by telling them that if they disbelieve they will have no protector or intercessor. Te witness here is the phrase “..that they might become righteous” In other words it’s “Make them fear from that fate that they might become righteous”. Surah 82 verse 19: It’s not related to intercession. It states a fact that no soul will have any power to direct another soul to paradise or hell. Everything is/ will be in God’s power.What happened to pharaoh? According to Surah 10 verse 92; Allah saved him. According to Surah 17 verse 103 says that he drowned.Answer : I will quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 10 verse 92: “So today We will save you in body that you may be to those who succeed you a sign. And indeed many among the people of Our signs are heedless” Surah 17 verse 103: “So he intended to drive them from the land but We drowned him and those with him all together” As you can see this man is a complete idiot. He can’t even understand basic words. In the first Surah God tells us that he will save his body to be a sign for God’s wrath for those who will come after him. Was he spared punishment and drowning? No but unlike his soldiers his body was found and mummified.He talks about abrogation in the Quran which is a highly disputed topic. He says in Surah 2 verse 256 “there is no compulsion in religion”. Whereas Surah 9 verse 29 says “Fight those who don’t believe in Allah”.Answer : I will quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 2 verse 256: “There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong. So whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing” Surah 9 verse 29: “Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the Scripture - [fight] until they give the jizyah willingly while they are humbled” I guess first verse is no problem for him. He talks about the second one about fighting. All interpreters of the Quran Islamic Historians Jurists and Biographers agree that this verse in particular was a divine command to fight the Byzantines because they killed a companion of the Prophet who was sent with a message to them. So it’s not a general rule. Here in Egypt we don’t fight Coptic Christians for example!!. But i will assume that it’s a general rule for his sake. Where in that verse does it command us to force convert people? It clearly says fight to take tribute from the not to make them Muslims!.Is a Muslim allowed to drink alcohol? According to Surah 4 verse 43: Yes. According to Surah 5 verse 90: No.Answer : I will quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 4 verse 43 : “O you who have believed do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you are saying or in a state of janabah except those passing through [a place of prayer] until you have washed [your whole body]. And if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the place of relieving himself or you have contacted women and find no water then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and your hands [with it]. Indeed Allah is ever Pardoning and Forgiving” Surah 5 verse 90 : “O you who have believed indeed intoxicants gambling [sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than Allah ] and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan so avoid it that you may be successful” I feel complete retardness when i answer such well-known questions! But i have to because some people don’t know Islam that much. Anyway The Quran was revealed to the Prophet (peace be upon him) along 23 years approximately. Some rulings were stated and applied gradually because people couldn’t indulge in religion so fast. So for example the Muslim prayer started as a regular prayer to God to ask him for guidance and it was twice a day. The same happened with alcohol. Arabs used to drink so many sorts of alcohol and mention it in their poems..etc. It was an integrated part of their meetings. So when God wanted us to stop alcohol he instructed us in a gradual way in order not to make it hard on people. So the first verse this guy mention is at the beginning of the ban. God tells us not to come to prayer while drunk. Which means 5 times a day you can’t be drunk. Then in the second verse he tells us to stop totally and it was after they followed the first order to be sober nearly more than half the day.What is the penalty for sexual sin? Surah 4 verse 15 tells us it’s house arrest while Surah 24 verse 2 tells us 100 lashes.Answer : I will quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 4 verse 15 : “Those who commit unlawful sexual intercourse of your women - bring against them four [witnesses] from among you. And if they testify confine the guilty women to houses until death takes them or Allah ordains for them [another] way” Surah 24 verse 2 : “The woman or man found guilty of sexual intercourse - lash each one of them with a hundred lashes and do not be taken by pity for them in the religion of Allah if you should believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a group of the believers witness their punishment” The first verse he mentions is about Lesbians not adultery or fornication. Whereas the second verse is about Adultery/Fornication.Done Alhamdoullillah and Allah knows best.",Mohammed Said,https://www.quora.com/profile/Mohammed-Said-161

Matsya Kurma Varaha Nrsimha and Vamana appeared in Satya Yuga. Parsurama and Rama incarnated in Tretya yuga but Lord Rama is still worshipped. Lord Krishna and Balarama appeared in Dwarpya yuga but usually Lord Krishna is considered the original Supreme personality of Godhead and is worshipped in all Ages. Buddha and later Kalki are the incarnations for kali yuga but because this is a special Kali Yuga Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu appeared to spread the sankirtana movement. For ten thousand years this glorious movement shall enlivened and bring joy and peace to the masses.

Why is Navagraha the last to be prayed to in a temple?

The Navagrahas emanate superb radiant energy (which does exist in all temples everywhere but the Navagraha-energy is very vibrant) which travels back and forth from them to the temple’s main kalasha as all the energies do. Then unlike the rest (most) of the energies the Navagraha-energy which came from one Navagraha eventually ends up in another Navagraha. In short the energy from deity A. after bouncing back from the kalasha goes to deity B. not deity A. By travelling 9 times around the Planetary deities one absorbs the energy of a deity given out by another deity. This receiving is indirect unlike the direct receiving of energy from the main god/goddess of the temple. Hence in order to receive indirect energies after receiving direct energies one must follow the order of first main deity then the Navagrahas. The reason for the order: first direct receiving then indirect receiving is very complicated and requires the audience to know about how divine energy is transmitted in various ways.The rest of the deities must be worshipped in between order doesn’t matter. You can go first Shiva then Durga or first Durga then Shiva. Sometimes people actually do not care who goes first and worship the surrounding deities (for ex. Durga Shiva etc.) then main deity (ex. Muruga). So people actually like that sometimes worship the non-main deity then the main deity. But 3 things are clear as a summary:Ganesh first if there is a place to worship him and if it is a Shaivite templeDon’t forget to worship the main deity… :)Navagrahas go last if there is a place for them,Iniyan Achyudhan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Iniyan-Achyudhan

VEDAS 1. rig-veda -- The foremost of Vedas: a collection of Illuminating Hymns of Wisdom called sūktas or Mantras composed of Riks (ric rik or rig— verse) addressed to the Devas or Gods. These hymns verbalise the mystical experiences of the sages or Riṣis in deep states of meditation. 2. sāma-veda -- texts of Harmonious Joyful Chants or Sāmans to be sung to certain melodies. A recast of the Rig-Veda broken up into parts and arranged for purposes of being chanted at the various Vedic sacrifice. 3. yajur veda -- the texts of Sacrificial Rites or Yajus (yajur) or the right ordaining of action. It consists principally of prayers and invocations applicable to the consecration of the utensils and materials of sacrificial worship but also symbolic of the means by which man attains divinity. This Veda is divided into two parts 'The White' and 'The Black'. 4. atharva-veda -- sacred texts of mystical formulas and chants to be used during certain ceremonies such as the marriage birth and funeral ceremonies as well as formulae intended to counteract the effect of karmic diseases and forces of chaos. Each of these Vedas is divided into four divisions: 1. sūktas or mantras — Poetic hymns of praise 2. brāhmaṇas — Works in prose dealing with Vedic ritual along with stories myths explanations theology philosophy and traditional matter . 3. āraṇyakas — treatises dealing with philosophical and theological subjects attached to the Brahmanas for study by ascetics of the forest. 4.

It looks to me that the later was more true. Worshiping Lord Raghuvir (Ram) and Sitala Devi (A form of Durga) as family deities was in vogue in Sri Ramakrishna's family. But there doesn't seem to be any specific instance of Sri Ramakrishna's 'attachment' to Sitala Devi for worship in his early years. Sri Ramakrishna's first ""encounter"" with Maa Kali seems have happened when he took a pilgrimage as a boy along with local women to Anoor Visalakshi Temple. As he was walking with the women singing bhajans on Divine mother he suddenly went into a trance - attaining bhava Samadhi and getting immersed in overwhelming emotions on Devi. Later in his late teens he went to Kolkata to assist his elder brother Ramkumar who was earning the very livelihood through practicing purohitam (priesthood) for the family stricken with poverty at Kamarpukur. Ramkumar got appointed to to Dakshineswar Kali temple as the priest and Sri Ramakrishna too shifted to the temple premises only very reluctantly. Interestingly the orthodox Brahmin mindset he had in those days made him decline to eat Kali's Prasad! I believe it was gradually afterword that Dakshineswar Bhavatarini Kali started Her divine play of 'possessing' the reluctant Village Brahmin teenager and making him her own and finally making his Self her own divine abode! The rest is history. Kali worship Tantra and Sri Ramakrishna Regarding significance of Kali Worship Shaktas will give lots of reasons based on Puranas and Tantra Shastras about the superiority of Kali worship over other sects. In my opinion it was another very strong sect (like Gaudiya Vaishnavism in Bengal) existing in those periods thanks to the widespread practice of Tantra amid Bengalis. It may be pointed out that Sri Ramakrishna practiced Tantra under the methodical and strict guidance of Bhairavi Brahmani and attained the pinnacle of divine experience as per Tantra Shastras. But during his days Tantra Shastra had attained quite a bad reputation because it was conveniently misunderstood and practiced by many to enjoy drinking and sex. Leaving behind the core idea of transcending those meaner pulls to attain divinity (Unity of Shiva and Shakti) through enjoying and overcoming Tantra in practice had considerably degenerated those days. By the strength of his divine experience Sri Ramakrishna strongly warned against those practices of Tantra; he pointed out that the chances of falling were rather more than succeeding by the secret practicing of indulgence in the Pancha Makaras -- madya (wine) māṃsa (meat) matsya (fish) mudrā (parched grain) and maithuna (sexual intercourse) of the Tantra.Sri Ramakrishna prescribed Bhakti as the bes...",C.V.Rajan,https://www.quora.com/profile/C-V-Rajan-1

Why are some Hindus hostile towards ISKCON?,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-some-Hindus-hostile-towards-ISKCON,,I am very much qualified to answer this question. I am from a Tamil shaivaite Hindu family; we pray to Lord Vishnu and his avatars but it is not as much as frequent as our prayers to Lord Shiva Lord Karthikeya and Lord Ganesha and Maa Sakthi. Even my first name Guhan refers to Lord Karthikeya. My first experience with ISKCON was in Bengaluru when I visited the beautiful temple complex of ISKCON Bengaluru with my friends. We danced in joy like fellow worshipers there and I was filled with new energy to explore more. I was spellbound by the appearance of Lord Krishna and Radha and felt magical there. I sensed strong energy there. I wished to be there for sometime and we bought several books to know much about Gita and other discourses about Vaishnavism. It happened in February 2017. When I moved to Pondicherry in July 2017 I was introduced to ISKCON Pondicherry community by some of my friends. I used to go there on Sundays and attend the prayer and do service there. It made me very content and I felt happy. One day I went early to listen to lectures given by one of the gurus there . What I heard in that lecture shocked me. He mentioned that considering any god be it Lord Shiva or anyone closer to Vishnu or equal to Vishnu is one of the greatest sins. He told me that Shiva is a demigod and cannot be equated to Vishnu . I was very much shocked. Born in a shaivaite family I had a feeling that I was cheating on my parents. My parents could never accept this. I was shell shocked. He further proceeded that shaivaites would pray to Vishnu but there cannot be a true vaishnavite who would pray to Shiva. I felt really bad. Though I am a shaivaite I have always seen Vishnu as a god equal to Shiva. Hinduism is all about trimoorthy and Sakthi  but isckon preaches the superiority of single god similar to Abrahamic religions. Only this which makes it different from Abrahamic religions is that it doesn't claim Vishnu as the only god. I found all the statements of the gurus something similar to the preachings of Christian missionaries who always demonize Hindu Gods and make them inferior in front of Jesus. ISKCON is doing the same.,Guhan Priyadharshan Paramasivam,https://www.quora.com/profile/Guhan-Priyadharshan-Paramasivam

The idol is designed such that it gets the sunlight directly and thus appears sparkling. The origin of the name ""Murdeshwar"" dates to the time of Ramayana. The Hindu gods attained immortality and invincibility by worshiping a divine Linga called the Atma-Linga( Soul of Shiva). Ravana wanted the Atma Linga and prayed to Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva was pleases and gave him the boon with a condition that it was not to be placed on the ground. But Ravan was tricked and realising that Atma Linga was placed on the ground was furious and tried to destroy the Linga. Due to the force exerted by Ravana some pieces were scattered. One such piece from the head of the Linga is said to have fallen in present-day Surathkal. The famous Sadashiva temple is said to be built around that piece of linga. Then he decided to destroy the covering of the Atma Linga and threw the case covering it to a place called Sajjeshwar. Then he threw the lid of the case to a place called Guneshwar (now Gunavanthe) and Dhareshwar. Finally he threw the cloth covering the Atma Linga to a place called Mrideshwar in Kanduka-Giri (Kanduka Hill). Mrideshwar has been renamed to Murudeshwar.4.SARVESHWAR MAHADEV STATUE IN GUJARAT INDIA This Lord Shiva Statue is situated in the middle of Sur Sagar Lake in Vadodara Gujarat.

Why is Ramcharitmanas hailed above Gita Vedas Itihasas and Puranas? What is the real reason behind?,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Ramcharitmanas-hailed-above-Gita-Vedas-Itihasas-and-Puranas-What-is-the-real-reason-behind,,Because of Simplicity. Anyone can read and understand it. I can even say that “Ramcharitmanas” alone is sufficient for bhakti. various things that would take days to understand from Gita or Upanishads can easily be understood from Ramcharitmanas. A Vedanti when studies Ramcharitmanas he could see parallel dohas for every important concepts of Vedas Itihaas and Purans. Take a example: भोक्ता भोग्यं प्रेरितारं च मत्वा सर्वं प्रोक्तं त्रिविधं ब्रह्ममेतत् ॥ श्वेताश्वतर उप.१.१२॥ //BhOktA BhOgyam PrEritAram cha matvA sarvam prOktam trividham Brahmam Etat// यस्मात्क्षरमतीतोऽहमक्षरादपि चोत्तमः। अतोऽस्मि लोके वेदे च प्रथितः पुरुषोत्तमः।। (गीता 15.18) //yasmātkṣaramatītō.hamakṣarādapi cōttamaḥ. atō.smi lōkē vēdē ca prathitaḥ puruṣōttamaḥ৷৷// परवश जीव स्ववश भगवंता जीव अनेक एक श्रीकंता।। //parvash jeev swavash bhagwanta; jeev anek ek shrikanta// (Except the husband of Sri all are jeevatmas.) उभय बीच सीय सोभति कैसे जीव ब्रह्म बिच माया जैसे।। //ubhay beech Siya sohati kaise; jeev brahm beech maya jaise// (Jeev Brahm and Maya are three eternal truths.) ज्ञान अखंड एक सीतावर माया बस जीव सचराचर। जो सबके रहे ज्ञान एकरस ईश्वर जीवहिं भेद कहहु कस।। (रामचरितमानस) Read yourself and decide which is more clear to comprehend? Lord Shankar himself stamped it with his singnature and put this shastra above Ved Itihaas and Purans. Comparing with valmiki Ramayan In the story of jayanta valmiki goes on the decribe in long how the crow hit the chest of Sita how the blood was oozing. It’s certainly not a correct description for a putra. In Ramcharitmanassita charan chonch hati bhaga The crow Jayanta hit with his chonch (beak) and feet.But where?chala rudhir raghunayak jaaga blood flow reached and awakened Ram.Now Ram was sleeping in the lap of Sita. So obviously the blood is coming from upside. Tulsi said everything but he didn't said anythingmarm vachan sita jab boli hari prerit lakshman mati doliWhat’s the ‘marm vachan? Valmiki describes in detail. Also Valmiki description of thighs and chest of Sita (although from the perspective of third person) is not suited for putra-bhaav. Hence Ramcharitmanas is even more suited than Valmiki Ramayan in kaliyuga.,Manish Kumar,https://www.quora.com/profile/Manish-Kumar-3336

When Mahabali Chakravarthi an Asura King was doing yagna for the purpose of seeking the chair of Devendra to stop this yagna and to help Indira and other gods Lord Mahavishnu has taken an avatar of Vamana a dwarf brahmin came to Yagnasala and sought three of His feet of land as Biksha. The Asura King Mahabali immediately agreed to donate. Vamana who himself is Vishnu changed himself into Trivikrama in Viswaroopa pose put one giant step to possess the world second step to possess the heaven and asked Mahabali where he can put the third step. Mahabalai who is also a grand son of Prahladh a ardent devotee of Vishnu asked the God to put the third step on his head to take the Patala logh (beneath the earth) and as desired the God put His foot on his head and pushed him to patala.The Ulagalandha Perumal Temple was built during Nandivarma Pallava Period around 850–860 CE. Ulagalandha Perumal temple situated very near to the Kanchipuram bus stand is one of the most important temples of Kanchipuram the city of thousand temples. The temple is famous for the gigantic image of the main deity of Ulagalandha Perumal and has four other formats of Mahavishu within the temple complex. Picture courtesy Google.,V.

Later after the muslims captured it they - as usual tried destroying it by camouflaging it and making it like a makbara. If you don’t believe in it Here are the proofs with photographs. Look at it without any biases that you might have been fed with since long and you will know the truth. This presents photographs (listed below) that show the Vedic influence found in such buildings as the Taj Mahal Red Fort and other structures in India. In fact as recently as 1910 the Encyclopedia Brittanica also said that it was a pre-existing building before Shah Jahan. It is because of the manipulation of history by invaders that the true greatness of India and Vedic culture has been stifled or hidden. And it is time that people everywhere realize how numerous lies and false propaganda have been passed around as if it were the truth in regard to India and its past as well as its art archeology and the wonder of its culture. Descriptions of the Photographs of the Taj MahalPhoto # 1: “An aerial view of the Taj Mahal alias Tejo Mahalaya ancient Hindu temple complex in Agra. For the last 300 years the world has been fooled to believe that this stupendous edifice was built by the 5th generation Mogul emperor Shahjahan to commemorate one of his dead wives–Mumtaz. The two flanking buildings although identical only the one in the rear is known as a mosque. The Taj Mahal has seven stories. Five of them lie sealed and barred concealing rich evidence. The marble building in the centre is flanked by two symmetrical ones. The one in the foreground is the eastern one. The one in the background is being represented as a mosque because it is to the west. They should not have been identical if only one was to be a mosque. In the courtyard at the foot of the eastern building is inlaid a full scale replica of the trident pinnacle [found at the top of the dome]. The tiny tower at the left near the western building encloses a huge octagonal multi-storied well.”[1]Photo # 2: “This is the massive octagonal well with palatial apartments along its seven stories. A royal staircase descends right down to the water level indicated by the tiny white patch showing the sun’s reflection. This was the traditional treasury well of the Hindu temple palace. Treasure chests used to be stacked in the lower stories. Accountants cashiers and treasurers sat in the upper stories. Cheques called handies used to be issued from here. On being besieged if the building had to be surrendered to the enemy the treasure used to be pushed into the water for salvage later after recapture. For real research water should be pumped out of this well to reveal the evidence that lies at the bottom. This well is inside a tower near the so-called mosque to the west of the marble Taj. Had the Taj been a mausoleum this octagonal multistoried well would have been superfluous.” [1] [2]Photo # 3: “A frontal view of the Taj Mahal alias Tejo Mahalaya in Agra. It is octagonal because the Hindus believe in 10 directions. The pinnacle pointing to the heaven and the foundation to the nether world plus the eight surface directions make the 10 directions. Divinity and royalty are believed to hold sway in all those 10 directions. Hence in Hindu tradition buildings connected with royalty and divinity must have some octagonal features or the buildings themselves should be octagonal. The two flanking cupolas (two others to the rear are not seen in this photo) are also identical. The towers at the four plinth corners served as watch towers during the day and to hold lights at night. Hindu wedding altars and Satyanarayan worship altars invariably have such towers at corners. [Many other Hindu temples such as those at Khajurao also can be found to have four towers or temples one at each corner of the temple foundation.] The lotus flower cap on the head of the dome is a Hindu feature. Muslim domes are bald. This marble edifice has four stories. Inside the dome is an 83 ft. high hall. The Taj has a double dome. The dome one sees from inside ends like an inverted pan on the terrace. The dome seen from outside is a cover on the inner dome. Therefore in between them is an 83 ft. hall. This may be considered as one storey. Underneath may be seen the first storey arches and the ground floor rooms. In the basement visitors are shown one room. All these constitute the four storeys in the marble edifice. Below the marble structure are two stories in red stone reaching down to the river level. The 7th storey must be below the river level because every ancient Hindu historic building did have a basement. Thus the Taj is a seven-storied structure.” [1] [2]Photo # 4: “The dome of the Taj Mahal bearing a trident pinnacle made of a non-rusting eight-metal Hindu alloy. The pinnacle served as a lightning deflector too. This pinnacle has been blindly assumed by many to be an Islamic crescent and star or a lightning conductor installed by the British. This is a measure of the careless manner in which Indian history has been studied till now. Visually identifiable things like this pinnacle too have been misinterpreted with impunity. The flower top of the dome below the pinnacle is an unmistakable Hindu sign. A full scale figure of this pinnacle is inlaid in the eastern courtyard.”[1] [2]Photo # 5: “A close up of the upper portion of the pinnacle of the Taj Mahal photographed from the parapet beneath the dome. The Hindu horizontal crescent and the coconut top together look like a trident from the garden level. Islamic crescents are always oblique. Moreover they are almost always complete circles leaving a little opening for a star. This Hindu pinnacle had all these centuries been misinterpreted as an Islamic crescent and star or a lightning conductor installed by the British. The word “Allah” etched here by Shahjahan is absent in the courtyard replica. The coconut the bent mango leaves under it and the supporting Kalash (water pot) are exclusive Hindu motifs.”[1]Photo # 6: “The full scale figure of the pinnacle on the dome has been inlaid on the red stone courtyard of the Taj Mahal. One may see it to the east at the foot of the riverside arch of the flanking building wrongly dubbed as Jamiat Khana (community hall) by Muslim usurpers. Such floor sketches in courtyards are a common Hindu trait. In Fatehpur Sikri it is the backgammon board which is sketched on a central courtyard. The coconut top and the bent mango leaves underneath resting on a kalash (i.e. a water pot) is a sacred Hindu motif. Hindu shrines in the Himalayan foothills have identical pinnacles [especially noticed at Kedarnath a prominent Shiva temple]. The eastern location of the sketch is also typically Hindu. The length measures almost 32 ft.” [1]Photo # 7: “The apex of the lofty entrance arch on all four sides of the Taj Mahal bears this red lotus and white trident–indicating that the building originated as a Hindu temple. The Koranic lettering forming the middle strip was grafted after Shahjahan seized the building from Jaipur state’s Hindu ruler.” [1]Photo # 8: “This is a riverside view of the Taj Mahal. The four storied marble structure above has under it these two stories reaching down to the river level. The 22 rooms shown in other photos are behind that line of arches seen in the middle. Each arch is flanked by Hindu lotus discs in white marble. Just above the ground level is the plinth. In the left corner of the plinth is a doorway indicating inside the plinth are many rooms sealed by Shahjahan. One could step out to the river bank from the door at the left. The 7th storey is surmised to be under the plinth below the ground because every ancient Hindu mansion had a basement. Excavation to reach the basement chamber should start under this door.” [1]Photo # 9: “Most people content to see Mumtaz’s grave inside the Taj fail to go to the rear riverside. This is the riverside view. From here one may notice that the four-storied marble structure on top has below it two more stories in red stone. Note the window aperture in the arch at the left. That indicates that there are rooms inside. Inside the row of arches in the upper part of the wall are 22 rooms. In addition to the four stories in marble this one shows red stone arches in the 5th storey. The 6th storey lies in the plinth in the lower portion of the photo. In another photo a doorway would be seen in the left corner of the plinth indicating the presence of apartments inside from where one could emerge on the river for a bath.” [1]Photo # 10: “These corridors at the approach of the Taj Mahal are typically Hindu. They may be seen in any ancient Hindu capital. Note the two octagonal tower cupolas at the right and left top. Only Hindus have special names for the eight directions and celestial guards assigned to each. Any octagonal feature in historic buildings should convince the visitor of their Hindu origin. Guards palanquin bearers and other attendants resided in hundreds of rooms along numerous such corridors when the Taj Mahal was a Hindu temple palace. Thus the Taj was more magnificent and majestic before it was reduced to a sombre Islamic cemetery.” [1] [2]Photo # 11: “This Naqqar Khana alias Music House in the Taj Mahal garden is an incongruity if the Taj Mahal were an Islamic tomb. Close by on the right is the building which Muslims claim to be a mosque. The proximity of a mosque to the Music House is incongruous with Muslim tradition. In India Muslims have a tradition of pelting stones on Hindu music processions passing over a mosque. Moreover a mausoleum needs silence. A dead person’s repose is never to be disturbed. Who would then provide a band house for a dead Mumtaz? Contrarily Hindu temples and palaces have a music house because morning and evening Hindu chores begin to the sweet strains of sacred music.” [1]Photo # 12: “Such are the rooms on the 1st floor of the marble structure of the Taj Mahal. The two staircases leading to this upper floor are kept locked and barred since Shahjahan’s time. The floor and the marble walls of such upper floor rooms can be seen in the picture to have been stripped of its marble panels. Shahjahan used that uprooted marble from the upper floor for constructing graves and engraving the Koran because he did not know wherefrom to procure marble matching the splendour of the rest of the Taj Mahal. He was also so stingy as not to want to spend much even on converting a robbed Hindu temple into an Islamic mausoleum.” [1] [2]Photo # 13: “Such are the magnificent marble-paved shining cool white bright rooms of the Taj Mahal temple palace’s marble ground floor. Even the lower third portion of the walls is covered with magnificent marble mosaic. The doorway at the left looks suspiciously closed with a stone slab. One can perambulate through these rooms around the central octagonal sanctorum now occupied by Mumtaz’s fake grave. The aperture seen through of the central door enabled perambulating devotees to keep their eyes fixed on the Shiva Linga in the central chamber. Hindu Shiva Lingas are consecrated in two chambers one above the other. Therefore Shahjahan had to raise two graves in the name of Mumtaz–one in the marble basement and the other on the ground floor to desecrate and hide both the Shiva emblems from public view. [The famous Shiva temple in Ujjain also has an underground chamber for one of its Shiva-lingams.]” [1] [2]Photo # 14: “This is the Dhatura flower essential for Hindu Shiva worship. The flower is depicted in the shape of the sacred esoteric Hindu incantation ‘OM.’ Embossed designs of this blooming ‘OM’ are drawn over the exterior of the octagonal central sanctorum of Shiva where now a fake grave in Mumtaz’s has been planted. While perambulating around the central chamber one may see such ‘OM’ designs.” [1]Photo # 15: “This staircase and another symmetrical one at the other end lead down to the storey beneath the marble platform. Visitors may go to the back of the marble plinth at the eastern or western end and descend down the staircase because it is open to the sky. But at the foot the archaeology department has set up an iron door which it keeps locked. Yet one may peep inside from the iron gate in the upper part of the door. Shahjahan had sealed even these two staircases. It was the British who opened them. But from Shahjahan’s time the stories below and above the marble ground floor have been barred to visitors. We are still following Mogul dictates though long free from Mogul rule.” [1]Photo # 16: “On the inner flank of the 22 locked rooms (in the secret storey in red stone below the marble platform) is this corridor about 12 ft. broad and 300 ft. long. Note the scallop design at the base of the plinth supporting the arches. This is the Hindu decoration which enables one to identify even a bare plinth.” [1]Photo # 17: “One of the 22 rooms in the secret storey underneath the marble plinth of the Taj Mahal. Many such features of the Taj remain unknown to the public so long as they see it only as a tomb. If the public knew how much it is missing in the Taj Mahal it will insist that the government unseal its many stories. Two doorways at either end of this corridor in the right side wall leading to inner apartments have been sealed by Shahjahan. If those doorways are opened important evidence concealed inside by Shahjahan may come to light.” [1]Photo # 18: “A corner of one of the 22 rooms in the secret storey immediately below the marble platform of the Taj Mahal. Note the strips of Hindu paint on the wall. The ventilator at the left meant for air and light from the riverside has been crudely walled up by Shahjahan. He did not bother even to plaster them. Had Shahjahan built the Taj as a mausoleum what was the purpose of the 22 rooms? And why are they kept locked and hidden from the public?” [1]Photo # 19: “One of the 22 locked rooms in the secret storey beneath the marble platform of the Taj Mahal. Strips of ancient Hindu paint are seen on the wall flanking the doorway. The niches above had paintings of Hindu idols obviously rubbed off by Muslim desecraters. The rooms may be seen door within door in a row. If the public knew that the Taj Mahal is a structure hiding hundreds of rooms they would insist on seeing the whole of it. At present they only peep into the grave chamber and walk away.” [1]Photo # 20: “This esoteric Hindu design is painted on the ceiling of some of the 22 locked rooms in the secret storey below the marble platform of the Taj Mahal in Agra. Had Shahjahan built the Taj Mahal he would not have kept such elaborately painted rooms sealed and barred to the public. Even now one can enter these rooms only if one can influence the archaeology department to remove the locks.” [1]Photo # 21: “A huge ventilator of one of the 22 rooms in a secret storey of the Taj is seen here crudely sealed with unplastered bricks by Shahjahan. History has been so perverted and inverted that alien Muslims like Shahjahan who spoiled damaged desecrated and destroyed historic Hindu buildings are being falsely paraded as great builders.” [1] [3]Photo # 22: “One of the 22 riverside rooms in a secret storey of the Taj Mahal unknown to the public. Shahjahan far from building the shining marble Taj wantonly disfigured it. Here he has crudely walled up a doorway. Such imperial Mogul vandalism lies hidden from the public. This room is in the red stone storey immediately below the marble platform. Indian history has been turned topsy turvy in lauding destroyers as great builders.” [1]Photo # 23: “Many such doorways of chambers in secret stories underneath the Taj Mahal have been sealed with brick and lime. Concealed inside could be valuable evidence such as Sanskrit inscriptions Hindu idols the original Hindu model of the Taj the desecrated Shiva Linga Hindu scriptures and temple equipment. Besides such sealed chambers there are many which are kept locked by the Government. The Public must raise its voice to have these opened or it should institute legal proceedings. Shree P. N. Sharma of Green Park New Delhi who peeped through an aperture in these chambers in 1934 A.D. saw a pillared hall with images carved on the pillars.” [1] [2] [3]Photo # 24: “Burharpur is a very ancient historic city on the Central Railway between Khandwa and Bhusawal junctions. Burhanpur and the nearby Asirgarh (fort) used to provide hospitality to Hindu royals proceeding north or south on pilgrimage weddings or military expeditions. Barhanpur has many magnificent mansions which are currently being described as mosques and tombs of alien Islamic invaders. This building is one such ancient Hindu royal palace captured by the Moghuls. Mumtaz died here during her 14th delivery around 1630 A.D. while she and Shahjahan were camping here. She is said to be buried in a Hindu pavilion in front of this palace.” [1]Photo # 25: “Mumtaz is supposed to be buried in this garden pavilion of the ancient Hindu palace (Ahu Mahal) 600 miles from Agra in Burhanpur. Another version says that Mumtaz’s corpse was kept here exposed to sun rain and wild beasts for six months. The date of her death the date of her removal from Burhanpur to Agra and the date of her assumed burial in the Taj Mahal are all unknown because the entire Taj Mahal-Mumtaz legend is a concoction from the beginning to end. [Mumtaz was only one of several hundred wives and women that Shahjahan kept in his harem.]” [1] [2] Descriptions of the Photographs of the Red Fort and Other Buildings in Delhi and Elsewhere in IndiaPhoto # 26: “This tablet raised inside Delhi’s Red Fort by modern archaeologists proclaims that Shahjahan (who ruled from 1628 to 1658 A.D.) built this fort from 1639 to 1648 A.D. As against this see the [next] photo of the painting of Shahjahan’s time preserved in the Bodleian Library Oxford. It depicts Shajahan receiving the Persian ambassador inside the fort in 1628 the very year of Shahjahan’s accession. Obviously the fort existed much before Shahjahan.” [1] [3]Photo # 27: “The 5th generation Mogul emperor Shahjahan is credited with having built the Red Fort in Delhi. Shahjahan ascended the throne in 1628 A.D. This contemporary painting shows him receiving the Persian ambassador in 1628 itself in the Diwan-i-Aam (Common Room) of the Red Fort itself. This painting preserved in the Bodleian Library Oxford was reproduced in the Illustrated Weekly of India (page 32) of March 14 1971. Since Shahjahan was in the fort in the year of his accession this documentary evidence disproves the notion that he built the fort. Compare with this the photo of the tablet in English raised inside the fort by the Govt. of India’s archaeology department asserting that Shahjahan built the fort during 1639-48. This is emphatic proof of Indian history having been thoroughly falsified during Muslim rule in India.” [1]Photo # 28: “The Red Fort in Delhi has in its Khas Mahal alias the King’s apartment the royal emblem of its builder King Anangoal. It consists of a pair of swords laid hilt to hilt curving upwards the sacred Hindu pot (kalash) above the hilts a lotus bud and a pair of scales of justice balanced over it. Dotted around are representations of the sun from whom Indian ruling dynasties claimed descent. At the sword points are two small conches considered sacred in Hindu tradition. Bigger conches may be seen at the left and right corners at the base. This royal Hindu insignia of the Hindu king who built Delhi’s Red Fort is still there in the Khas Mahal pavilion. But even this visual symbol has been blatantly misinterpreted. The two swords laid hilt to hilt curving upward are being inadvertently styled by ignorant guides archaeologists and historians as an Islamic crescent. The sacred Hindu Kalash (water pot) on the hilts is never noticed. The lotus bud on the kalash represents royal wealth. The pair of scales is symbolic of impartial justice.” [1]Photo # 29: “This perforated marble screen inside the Khas Mahal (i.e. the King’s own chamber) in Delhi’s Red Fort is a Hindu specialty. Such jalees are mentioned even in Ramayanic descriptions of palaces. Therefore some buildings claimed to be mosques in Ahmedabad which boast of such exquisite jalees (lattices) are Hindu edifices. The Hindu royal emblem mounted on the upper part of the jalee disproves that the Mogul Shahjahan built the fort.” [1] Photos # 30 & 31: “The resplendent Hindu midday sun (from whom Hindu rulers claim descent) in the arch above flanked by the sacred Hindu letter OM. Below it is the royal Hindu insignia. This proves the hollowness of the claim that Shahjahan commissioned the Red Fort.” [1] [2] [3]Photo # 32: “It is entirely false that the Red Fort of Delhi was built by Shahjahan in 1639-48 A.D. Muslims were the destroyers of statues. Then why should they have constructed statues? But there are statues of Hindu Mahavants riding the elephants of the doors of each interior room of “Khas Mahal” in the Red Fort. On the main gate of the Fort named “Delhi Darwaja” there are huge statues of elephants. The curtain of building statues of elephants on forts and palace gates can be well judged by examining the palaces at Gwalior Udaipur and Kota. Decorating homes forts palaces and temples with elephants is a hoary Hindu tradition. To the Hindu an elephant symbolizes might power glory and wealth. The Red Fort in Delhi has life-size elephants at its gate and elephants with riders atop its door knobs in the Khas Mahal pavilion. Had Shahjahan built the fort such Hindu motifs should not have been there.” [3]Photo # 33: “A close up of the elephant and rider door knob in the Khas Mahal of the Red Fort in Delhi. This is a typically Hindu motif. Other big life-size stone elephants decorating the Naqqar Khana (Music House) gate were slaughtered by Islamic invaders. The chopped up pieces may still be seen stored in the Khas Mahal basements. The public must insist on these being joined and displayed.” [4]Photo # 34: “Inner view of the entrance to the so-called Moti Masjid inside Delhi’s Red Fort. The archaeological tablet outside claims that the mosque was built by Aurangzeb son and successor of Shahjahan. That claim is baseless because (1) The entrance is of a temple design. (2) The arch between the domes is made of banana bunches used in Hindu worship. (3) On either side above the arch are fruit trays. (4) Naming buildings after gems (Moti means pearl) is a Hindu custom. (5) If Shahjahan built the fort why didn’t he provide it with a mosque? (6) The truncated Hindu perambulatory passage may still be seen to exist on the building’s left flank. (7) The back of the wall shows signs of tampering.” [1] [3]Photo # 35: “A close-up of the interior top of the entrance arch of the so-called Moti Masjid (which was Hindu Moti Mandir) inside Delhi’s Red Fort. The arch at the bottom may be seen to be made of banana bunches. On either side above the arch are trays holding five fruits each as holy Hindu offering. Fruit is taboo inside Muslim mosques.” [1] [4]Photo # 36: “This temple-front design of ribbed gourd-like domes on either side with a pinnacle surmounted by a canopy in the centre embossed on the riverside wall of the Rang Mahal apartment inside Delhi’s Red fort is emphatic proof that the fort is a pre-Shahjahan Hindu fort. Even the name Rang Mahal is Hindu. In this same pavilion is carved on the floor an exquisite lotus in full bloom as a fountain trough. Muslim walls and floors are plain. The canopy in the photo may be seen at several Hindu altars. The kalash (pot) under it represents divinity in Hindu tradition.” [1]Photo # 37: ‘”Vishnu’s footprint’ in the so-called Humayun Tomb New Delhi. This photo is reproduced from page 78 of “The World of Ancient India” translated into English (from G. Le Bon’s original French book published in the 19th century) by David Macrae Tudor Publishing co. New York 1974. This photo proves that the so-called Humayun mausoleum is an ancient Hindu temple palace. Inquiries with archaeologists in Delhi drew a blank They have never seen these footprints which indicates that they are heir to a lot of non-information and mis-information. Humayun is not at all buried in Delhi. According to Farishta’s chronicle (English translation by John Briggs Vol. II page 174) Humayun is buried in Agra while according to Abul Fazal (Elliot & Dowson Vol. VI page 22) Humayun lies buried in Sirhind.” [1] [2]Photo # 38: “A panel of the so-called Kutab tower in Delhi. The exquisite serpentine Hindu pattern in the upper part is the wreath called ‘Makar Torana’ because it emanates from the mouth of a crocodile. This is a very common sacred Hindu motif in historic buildings. The Islamic tampering and forgery in stone may be seen in the lower portion. An attempt has been made to plant Koranic lettering. Such forgery in stone fooled even historians who thereby inadvertently ascribed those buildings to Muslim authorship.”[1]Photo # 39: “This remnant of a temple around the so-called Kutab Minar in Delhi has been named ‘Kuwat-ul-Islam’ mosque by the conqueror Kutubuddin in the closing years of the 12th century A.D. The term signifies “The Strength of Islam” in capturing and battering a Hindu temple and blatantly using it as a mosque. Ignorant historians who could not explain away the Hindu workmanship foolishly concluded that the Muslims demolished some other temple and carried the Hindu pillars hither to raise this ‘mosque (?).’ This is an absurdity from every point of view. Muslims only seized Hindu temples and pressed them into service as mosques.” [1] Photo # 40 & #41: “Muslim captors dismantled surface stones of the so-called Kutab tower in Delhi reversed them and inscribed Koran on the exterior. This Muslim forgery in stone came to light as those stones started falling off the tower. Here we can see the Hindu images on one side while the next view Photo # 41: reveals the subsequent Islamic lettering on the other.” [1]Photo # 42: “Four miles from the so-called Kutab Minar in Delhi is an ancient Hindu temple palace currently known as Sultan Ghari. An uncrowned son of sultan Iltmash (around 1230 A.D. ) is believed buried in it. That is a myth because there is no grave there. A Sanskrit inscription was also found in its ceiling. The beams of the octagonal crypt bore figures of Kamadhenu (celestial cow) and Varaha ([Lord Vishnu’s incarnation as a] wild boar). A Muslim tomb would never sport two highly detested animals. These two animals were a royal Hindu insignia. Even today five such pig-faced drain pipes may be seen projecting out of the walls of the royal pavilions inside Delhi’s Red Fort. Had Shahjahan built the fort as is currently believed he wouldn’t have had pigs peering from over his royal Islamic head since pigs are deeply detested by Islam. Contrarily the wild boar is an Hindu incarnation and sacred royal Hindu emblem. This is one of the visual proofs of the Hindu origin of Delhi’s Red Fort. So careless has been the study of Indian history that such graphic proofs have remained unnoticed. For similar more evidence read Mr. P. N. Oak’s research book titled “Delhi’s Red Fort is Hindu Lalkot.” [This photo was repeated elsewhere in the album under which was a caption that was completely different. You may want to read it as well which follows:]” [2] [3] [1] This ancient Hindu royal emblem of a wild boar (left) and the cow was found engraved on a lintel of what has been euphemistically called Sultan Ghari four miles from the Kutab Minar in Delhi. This proves that the so-called tomb was originally a Hindu palace. Like thousands of other buildings throughout India that palace too was pressed into Muslim use. Sultan Altmash’s son is believed to be buried there. Yet the tomb is not known after him but merely as the “Sultan’s Cavern.” Scholars have been wrong in believing that the building was built after the prince’s death. All such mediaeval tombs and mosques are erstwhile Hindu palaces and temples. That is why their decor is entirely Hindu. Historians and archaeologists hard put to explain away Hindu decor of what they believed to be Muslim buildings improvised the absurd justification that the building must have been fashioned out of the debris of some Hindu buildings or that the workmen being Hindu built in the Hindu style. Both these arguments are wrong. No building worth its name can be built out of debris. Similarly no workman ever dare or would ever care to fashion a building for which he is hired according to his own taste opposed to that of the owner’s. In this case the lintel was plastered over when the building was used as a Muslim tomb because the Islamic conscience cannot tolerate idolatrous images. Such tactics were used by Muslim invaders in all lands they overran when making use of captured buildings. A Sanskrit inscription was also found in the roof of the building. The building is octagonal in shape which is also a Hindu specialty. This royal Hindu emblem and another found in the Red Fort in Delhi stress the need for historians to look for and collect all such ancient Hindu royal emblems. This is a very enchanting and engrossing task that faces all those who are interested in rewriting Indian history after a millennium of Islam distortion and destruction.

Should women marry rich men?,https://www.quora.com/Should-women-marry-rich-men,,Tonight I found out my husband has multiple tens of thousands of dollars squirreled away that I had no idea about. I'm shocked. From 2007-2017 he was a broke-ass student and I was the main breadwinner. We had pennies to our name at some points. So I didn't marry the guy for his money. What impressed me about him when we were dating was that even when he made next to nothing he ALWAYS saved what he could every month. Even if it was only $20. This told me that:He was responsibleHe planned aheadHe aspired to something greaterHe was not impulsiveHe was not materialisticHe derived happiness from himself not external shitHe put a lot of thought into the things he did spend his money onAt the time we connected I had creditors calling me about debts I accrued when I was 18. So I learned a lot from him. A smart woman will see that how her partner thinks about money is WAY more important than how much he actually has. You can be rich one day and penniless the next if you haven't got your wits about you after all. But what do I know I feel like we've basically won the lottery tonight.

Fearful Kansa attempted many times thereafter to kill Lord Krishna. He grew in Vrindavan with his foster parents Yashoda & Nandibaba. Subhadra was his sister and Balram was his brother. knowledge of Holy Shrimad Bhagavad Gita There are numerous verses to consider from Srimad Bhagavad Gita which prove there is some other Supreme God about whom the narrator of Gita Ji (seeming to be Shri Krishna Ji) refers. Let us study them to understand who delivered the knowledge of Holy Srimad Bhagavad Gita. Brahm (Kaal) had pledged that he would never appear before anyone in his original form. He is the narrator of the Holy Gita. Gita Adhyay 11 Shlok 32 By entering into Shri Krishan Ji's body like a ghost Kaal is saying ""Arjun I am an enlarged Kaal. I have appeared now to eat all the loks”. Gita Adhyay 7 Shlok 25 the giver of the knowledge of Bhagavad Gita ie. Kaal says: Arjun I remain hidden with my yog-maya (mystic powers) I do not come in front of anyone. This is my bad (cheap) firm rule this is my incorruptible rule. Foolish people not knowing my bad ie. Inferior eternal main character consider the unmanifested / invisible me as having come in human form i.e. I am not Krishna. Gita Adhyay 11 Shlok 47 Speaker of Gita-Kaal says This is my actual Kaal form. Nobody can see this ie. attain Brahm by any method mentioned in the Vedas or by jap tap or by any other activity. This proves that the speaker of pious Gita Ji is not Lord Krishna but someone else (Kaal / Brahm) who says ‘I am an enlarged Kaal’. He counsels Arjun to fight the battle imparts knowledge and describes who is the Supreme God? who should be worshipped by devotees to attain eternal world and supreme peace ie. salvation. Various slokas of Holy Gita this Kaal-God (giver of the knowledge of pious Gita Ji) glorifies the Master of Lineage the creator of the universe the Supreme God. Let us review the dialogues held in the battlefield in Kurukshetra during the war of Mahabharata between Kaal/Brahm and the warrior Arjun. Arjun had refused to fight the battle realizing the catastrophic aftermaths of the war. At that time Kaal entered into the body of Lord Krishna like a ghost and provokes him to fight.

( Each one is better than other in path of self realization and all these emerged by debating merits and demerits of each school of thoughts in most non-violent way by Vedic Scholars) 1. Samkhya. This is an oldest and strongly dualism theoretical exposition of consciousness and matter. Samkhya School espouses dualism between consciousness and matter. It regards the universe as consisting of two realities: Purusha (Consciousness) and prakriti (matter). Samkhya philosophy includes a theory of gunas (qualities innate tendencies psyche). Guna it states are of three types: Sattva being good compassionate illuminating positive and constructive; Rajas guna is one of activity chaotic passion impulsive potentially good or bad; and Tamas being the quality of darkness ignorance destructive lethargic negative. Everything all life forms and human beings state Samkhya scholars have these three gunas but in different proportions. The interplay of these gunas defines the character of someone or something of nature and determines the progress of life. 2. Yoga this comprises the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. Many types of Yoga such as raja yoga jnana yoga karma yoga bhakti yoga tantra yoga mantra yoga laya yoga and hatha yoga and closely related to Samkhya school of thoughts emphasising meditation contemplation and liberation. The Yoga school builds on the Samkhya school theory that jnana (knowledge) is a sufficient means to moksha (Liberation to Universal Spirit) 3. Nyaya or logic which explores sources of knowledge using Nyaya Sutras. It holds that human suffering results from mistakes/defects produced by activity under wrong knowledge (notions and ignorance and Moksha (liberation) it states is gained through right knowledge. The six means of knowledge are: •Pratyaksha: Knowledge thru Perception •Anumana : Knowledge thru Inference •Upamana : Knowledge by Comparison •Sabda : Knowledge directly through Words •Arthapatti : Knowledge thru postulation •Anupalabhi : Knowledge based on absence 4. Vaiseika an empiricist school of atomism. It postulates that all objects in the physical universe are reducible to atoms and that one's experiences are derived from the interplay of substance (a function of atoms their number and their spatial arrangements) quality activity commonness particularity and inherence. Knowledge and liberation are achievable by complete understanding of the world of experience. This philosophy is credited to Kashyapa during Vedic times. 5. Mimamsa: Mimamsa deals with analysis of Vedic mantras. There are two branches of Mimamsa called Purva mimamsa and Uttara mimamsa. The Purva mimamsa analyses the Karma part of Vedas and the Uttara mimamsa for Jnana part. 6. Vedanta: Vedanta came to be the dominant current of Hinduism in the post-medieval period. Vedanta again has several divisions and primary is Advaita and Dvaita. Advaita literally means ""not two sole unity"". It is a sub-school of Vedanta and asserts spiritual and universal non-dualism. Its metaphysics is a form of absolute monism that is all ultimate reality is interconnected oneness.Dvaita Vedanta is a dualistic interpretation of the Vedas espouses dualism by theorizing the existence of two separate realities. What are Vedas and What does it Preach? Ancient Vedic philosophy basically comprises of Vedas Puranas and Upanishads. The Vedas are perhaps the oldest written text on our planet today. The Vedas are divided into four groups Rigveda Yajurveda Samaveda and Atharvaveda. 1. Rig Veda: Hymns in Prayer (Stotras) forms dedicated to Gods in tradition. It is a collection of 1028 Vedic Sanskrit hymns and 10600 verses in all organized into ten books (Sanskrit: mandalas). The hymns are dedicated to Rigvedic deities. The books were composed by sages and poets from different priestly groups over a period. About two-thirds of Rigveda is about the gods Agni (Fire) and Indra (Ruler of the gods). Rigveda contains a sense of intimate communion between Nature and the Rishis or visionaries 2. Sama Veda: The Sama-Veda is the “Veda of chants” or “Knowledge of melodies”. Hymns in Music& Melody form. A collection of hymns used by the priests during the Soma sacrifice. Many of these duplicate in part or in whole hymns from the Rig Veda 3. Yajur Veda is the Veda of ritual. The ritual is to recreate the universe within our own psyche and thereby unite the individual with the universal 4. Atharva Veda: Hymns which were focused on avoid calamities and sufferings. Vedas - Wikipedia The Puranas The Purana literature are in story form and voluminous in nature. There are 18 main puranas and most of the popular puranas were written by Vyasa. Puranas were the medium to teach the common man on values of life through an intelligent weaving of mythological stories. Some of the most popular puranas include Skanda purana Agni Purana Bhagavatha Purana  Vishnu Purana  Siva Purana and so on….. The Upanishads: The Upanishads are largely philosophical works in dialog form. They discuss question of nature philosophy and the fate of the soul and contain some mystic and spiritual interpretations of the Vedas. The compiler of the Vedas and Puranas was Vyasa and referred as Veda Vyasa. Vedic Tradition: Hinduism:The word ""Hindu"" came into existence because ancient Persians pronounced Sanskrit river name ""Sindhu"" as ""Hindu"" and Greeks pronounced ""Hindus"" as ""Indus"". Ancient Persians(Indo-Iranians) share common ancestry with the ancient Indians. Indu or Sindu or Hindu cannot be called as a religion it is just a way of life for Indians. Hindu does not claim any one prophet; it does not worship any one god; it does not subscribe to any one dogma; it does not believe in any one philosophic concept; it does not follow any one set of religious rites or performances and it may broadly be described as a way of life and nothing more.Difference Hindu Traditions Hinduism has different traditions as below. Goddess Durga is a central deity in Shaktism tradition of Hinduism where she is equated with the concept of ultimate reality called Brahman.One of the most important texts of Shaktism is Devi Mahatmya also known as Durgā Saptashatī which celebrates Durga as the Goddess declaring her as the Supreme Being and the creator of the universe. In Shaiva traditions Lord Shiva is central deity and in Vaishnava traditions Lord Vishnu is central deityHindu could:1. Follow any of the Hindu schools of philosophy such as Advaita (non-dualism) Vishishtadvaita (non-dualism of the qualified whole) Dvaita (dualism) Dvaitadvaita (dualism with non-dualism)2. Follow a tradition centred on any particular form of the Divine such as Shaivism Vaishnavism Shaktism3. Practice any one of the various forms of yoga systems in order to achieve moksha – that is freedom in current life (jivanmukti) or salvation in after-life (videhamukti)4. Practice bhakti or puja for spiritual reasons which may be directed to one's guru or to a divine image.A visible public form of this practice is worship before an idol or statue. Meaning of Hindus is Indians. British called this section of people as people of Hindu religion(who were basically non-Abrahamic) for administrative purpose. However Hindus/Indians actually refers to people of civilization originated from Indus Valley ( One of most ancient civilization of the world)India is a place where you will still find beautiful mixture of all major races of world as shown above who arrived here in times. This is one place in the world where you can locate almost all the oldest surviving ancient religion/cultures of the world living together peacefully. Hindu religious scriptures date back up to 6000 years and as a known fact India has never invaded any country in its past 10000 years of history and the people associated with ancient civilizations across the world who came here along with their cultural past due to persecution or ill-treatment in their native were adapted and protected here in this great land just because of ""Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam"" the entire world is a family is what our philosophy teaches if you are a Hindu. ""Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah"" may all living beings live happily in peace may good happen to all may all prosper and live their lives to their fullest potential is what Hindus still follow. Our great Sages were so tolerant that they supported reforms regularly with idea of inclusiveness of several cultures that came to India in times and at same time developed study of Vedic knowledge that are supported by science and truth. Spread of Hindu Culture in Indian sub-continent: This Hindu culture and school of thoughts (referred as Sanatana Dharma) at one point was all over India and South East Asia. You can still see the remains of this rich culture in the Hindu temples of Angkor Wat Bali and Thailand. Sages were main reason to spread this culture and wherever these sages have travelled the culture has spread. It starts from Agastya Adi Shankaracharya so on. Agastya - Wikipedia Adi Shankaracharya helped to unite various school of thoughts under one single foundation of Sanatana Dharma (currently referred as Hinduism). Adi Shankara traveled across the Indian Subcontinent to propagate his philosophy through discourses and debates with other thinkers. The united Indian culture what we see today was due to Adi Shankara’s contribution those days.Most people say that it was Adi Shankaracharya who brought major reforms in Hindu philosophy and also supported in abolishing animal sacrifices. A good example would be custom of offering coconut instead of animal sacrifices in Hindu temples. Adi Shankara - Wikipedia",Arvind Bhagwath,https://www.quora.com/profile/Arvind-Bhagwath
What is the relation between Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu?,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-relation-between-Lord-Shiva-and-Lord-Vishnu,https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-51ede59f3091e458239c20539fb92e2c-lq,They are each others’ alter-egos. The secret is found in their iconography.(Pictures courtesy Google-images) In Vishnu’s upper left hand we find a conch and in the right a flaming discus. In Shiva’s upper left hand he holds a flame and in the right an hour-glass shaped drum. The conch and the drum have the same iconographical symbolism — creation through sound (sonic cosmogony) - the universe is created through the vibration of sound and the primeval sound being OM. The flaming discus and the flame are both symbols of destruction transformation and change. So by holding these symbols in opposite hands they are expressing their mutual dependency in a dance of Cosmic projection and withdrawl. Shiva is known as Naṭarāja — the King of Dance and Vishnu is known as Raṅga-nātha - the King of the stage. M.B. Santi Parva 341:22 – 27. Narayana is the Self of Rudra it should be known from age to age. If that god of gods (Maheshvara) be worshipped then O Partha is the mighty Narayana also worshipped. I [Krishna] am the Self O Arjuna of all the worlds of all the universe. Rudra again is my Self. It is for this reason that I always adore him. If I do not adore the auspicious and boon-giving Isana nobody would then adore Me in essence. The principles I set are followed by all the worlds. Those principles should always be respected and it is there­fore that I too respect them. He who knows Rudra knows Myself and he who knows Me knows Rudra. He who follows Rudra follows Me. Rudra is Narayana. Both are one Being appearing in two different forms. Rudra and Narayana forming one Being pervade all things and cause them to act.,Rami Sivan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Rami-Sivan

These chakras get cleansed only by Kundalini force and the most important purpose of meditating person to clean chakras by the process of using Kundalini Shakthi is to attain Shiva.

All that existed then was void and formless: by the great power of Warmth was born that One.—Rigveda Nasadiya suktaWho really knows? Who will here proclaim it?Whence was it produced? Whence is this creation?Gods came afterwards with the creation of this universe.Who then knows whence it has arisen?Whether God's will created it or whether He was mute;Perhaps it formed itself or perhaps it did not;Only He who is its overseer in highest heaven knowsOnly He knows or perhaps He does not know.—Rigveda 10:129-6“In the beginning arose the Golden Germ: he was as soon as born the Lord of Being sustainer of the Earth and of this Heaven. What God shall we adore with our oblation?“—Yajurveda(4:1:8 31)Devi sukta (10.125) states a goddess is all the creator the created universe the feeder and the lover of the universe;""Such is his magnificence but Purusha is greater than this;all beings are a fourth of himthree-fourths -- his immortality -- lie in heaven.""""Three-fourths of Purusha ascendedthe fourth part was here again and againand diversified in form it movedto the animate and the inanimate world.""—Purusha sukta from Yajuraranayaka (3:13 33& 34):It describes this form of His as having countless heads eyes legs manifested everywhere and beyond the scope of any limited method of comprehension. All creation is but a fourth part of Him. The rest is unmanifested.Upanishads have a less meta-physical but still highly philosophical description of a cyclical world-view. Universe is series eternal and endless cycles of creation and destructions. Each rishi/rishika has their own interpretation of universe ideas varies from one upanishad to another.:Purusha and Prakriti are taken a 2 abstractions of Matter and Energy OR Man and Nature OR the Laws and Process.The Universe endures for about 4320000000 years (one day of Brahma the creator or kalpa)and is then destroyed by fire or water elements. At this point Brahma rests for one night just as long as the day. This process called pralaya (cataclysm) repeats for 100 Brahma years (311 trillion 40 billion human years) that represents Brahma's lifespan.“Oh Gargi! The earth along with those which are above and below the earth the time that is past present and future are all in unmanifested space.”—Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (3:8 4)""There no sun shines no moon nor stars nor lightning; where could there be fire? From Him who shines all things derive their light -- it is His light that illumines this entire universe.""—Mundakopanishad (2:2 10)Purana Smrities Itihaas and later texts : here the arguments are more practical and more human centered this was perhaps done to make these ideas available to common folk in the form of stories and mythologies. The idea of parallely existing Multiverse is also quite fascinating. Rise of the trinity:Brahma :Brahma start creation in what is called a Kalpa which has 4 yuga 1 Krita Yuga = 1728000 years (4 times Kali yuga) 1 Treta Yuga = 1296000 years (3 times Kali yuga) 1 Dvapara Yuga = 864000 years (2 times kali yuga) 1 Kali Yuga = 432000 years Total duration of four yugas = 4320000 years = 1 Mahayuga This is one day of brahma when he sleeps at night the and equal cycle of Destruction happens called Pralay. Brahma eventually dies leaving behind a vary long period of non-existence called Mahapralay  until new Brahma arises. VishnuVishnu lies in a dream like state on the serpent Adi-sesha Ananta who is Time without beginning or end. Ananta floats for all eternity on the waters of the Ksheer Sagar ( the ocean of Cosmic Consciousness).As if he is seeing a dream Vishnu watches Brahma create the Universe. By the act of watching his dream Vishnu sustains the Universe. When Vishnu wakes from his dream one cycle of Creation ends.Vishnu who dreams up the Universe must also now protect it. To maintain the order of Creation Vishnu becomes The Protector. He takes the form of Ishwara or GodThis form of Vishnu looks very different from the one reclining on Ananta. He is standingradiant as the sun and has four arms. In his hands he holds the Conch The Discus The Lotus and The Mace. From the Nirguna Brahman( formless energy) Vishnu thus becomes Saguna Brahman a God with forms and attributes. Vishnu is now the Supreme LordParameshwar.Shiv/ShankarThe idol of Lord Nataraja (dancing God) depicts one of his four hands up in protection while the process of perpetual creation and annihilation goes on. In his upper right hand he holds a small drum (called damaruka) which taps out the first sound in the unfolding of the universe. This drum shaped like an hour-glass denotes the connection of creative sound and time. The first sound is said to be the 'Om' (pranava). The circle of fire in which he dances depicts continuity through the phases of creation preservation incarnation destruction and deliverance.Shiva's dance is a symbol of the unity and rhythm of existence. The unending dynamic process of creation and destruction is expressed in the energetic posture of Shiva. He dances in a ring of fire that refers to the life-death process of the universe. Everything is subject to continual change as energy constantly assumes new forms in the ""play"" (lila) of creation except the god himself whose dance is immutable and absolute. The pictorial allegory of Nataraja indicates the so-called ""five acts"" of the deity: the creation of the universe its sustenance in space its final dissolution at the end of the cycle of four world ages (yugas) the concealment of the nature of the godhead and the bestowal of true knowledge.Adi Shakti is the primordial Energy""I am Adi Parashakti goddess Bhuvaneshwari. I am the owner of this universe. I am the Absolute Reality. I am dynamic in feminine form and static in masculine form. You have appeared to govern the universe through my energy. You are the masculine form of Absolute Reality while I am the feminine form of that Reality. I am beyond form beyond everything and all the powers of God are contained within me. You must know that I am the Eternal limitless energy.”The MultiverseThere are innumerable universes besides this one and although they are unlimitedly large they move about like atoms in You. Therefore You are called unlimited (Bhagavata Purana 6.16.37)Because You are unlimited neither the lords of heaven nor even You Yourself can ever reach the end of Your glories. The countless universes each enveloped in its shell are compelled by the wheel of time to wander within You like particles of dust blowing about in the sky. The śrutis following their method of eliminating everything separate from the Supreme become successful by revealing You as their final conclusion (Bhagavata Purana 10.87.41)The layers or elements covering the universes are each ten times thicker than the one before and all the universes clustered together appear like atoms in a huge combination (Bhagavata Purana 3.11.41)And who will search through the wide infinities of space to count the universes side by side each containing its Brahma its Vishnu its Shiva? Who can count the Indras in them all--those Indras side by side who reign at once in all the innumerable worlds; those others who passed away before them; or even the Indras who succeed each other in any given line ascending to godly kingship one by one and one by one passing away (Brahma Vaivarta Purana)Few quotes:“He who out of his own free will spreads out this universe like a juggler or a great yogi; this universe which is characterized by the expanse of time-space continuum and which like a sprout in a seed earlier existed in an unmanifest form and is later manifested outside; to that creator Sri Dakshinamurthy who has himself manifested as my teacher are these salutations.” —Adi SankaraThe Upanishads compare God to a spider that weaves its web out of its own body and lies at the center of it. There is general agreement that the principle and source of the universe is Brahman. The resolution of the relationship between Brahman and the universe is the central theme of Vedanta and the Upanishads. The relative standpoint is Saguna Brahman the manifestation of Brahman by the human soul viewed through the human spectacles. Nirguna Brahman is the absolute standpoint where Brahman is God as He views Himself independently. Sankara's Advaita Vedanta explains whyBrahman individual soul (Atman) and the Universe are not different. Human being in the scale of spiritual progression has dual personality. They are partly animal and partly god moving in two worlds the world of Nature and the world of Spirit. ""By eliminating all the limitations of the body mind and intellect the Self can be realized. The human being is potentially divine and can overcome the limitations.”—Swami Vivekananda""The Hindu dharma is the only one of the world's great faiths dedicated to the idea that the Cosmos itself undergoes an immense indeed an infinite number of deaths and rebirths. It is the only dharma in which time scales correspond to those of modern scientific cosmology. Its cycles run from our ordinary day and night to a day and night of Brahma 8.64 billion years long longer than the age of the Earth or the Sun and about half the time since the Big Bang."" —Carl SaganIf you are inclined towards Hindu cosmology as well as Physics please read :The Tao of Physics I cannot emphasize this enough.

Maa Gauri is the rebirth of Maa Sati who was born to retrieve Lord Shiva as her husband and to destroy the wicked. Mother Gauri was the daughter of Daksha that's why mother Parvati is also the granddaughter of Brahma. Maa Gauri is also called Durga. It is mentioned in the Puranas that Maa Gauri and Lord Rudra were first born due to the anger of Brahma. (Markandeya Purana Canto L)Next Brahmā further created Rudra whose birth was from his soul when it was angry and Saṅkalpa and Dharma who was begotten before all the preceding sons. And those who with their sons and other relatives were first created by the Self-existent felt no attachment for the worlds but showed disregard and were composed in mind. They all knew the future they were free from passion free from envy. When they thus showed disregard at the creation of the worlds the high-souled Brahmā grew very wrathful; then was produced there a male like to the sun possessed of an immense body the body being half man’s and half woman’s. “Divide thyself” said the god and then disappeared.Lord Rudra and Mata Gauri were born in the form of Ardhanaresvara from the anger of Lord Brahma. Skanda Purana Kedāra-khanda (Chapter 20)Thus his queen was made to comply by the Mountain. Then the lucky Menā conceived a girl in her womb. She was the great Vidyā the great Māyā the embodiment of the highest intellect. She was Ambā the great daughter of Dakṣa Rudrakālī Satī. The chaste lady of beautiful eyes and excellent fortune Menā bore in her womb that highest glory of large eyes. Then Devas sages Yaksas and Kinnaras eulogized Menā of excessive fortune and the Mountain Himavān. In the meantime their daughter named Girijā was born. When the goddess the bestower of happiness on all manifested herself divine drums were sounded; celestial damsels danced; lords of Gandharvas sang; Siddhas and Cāraṇas eulogized (her); Devas showered plenty of flowers. Then everything the entire unit of the three worlds became delighted. When the great Satī Girijā incarnated herself Daityas became excessively frightened. The groups of Devas the great Sages Cāraṇas and the groups of Siddhas attained great joy.Mother Gauri was Sati in her previous birth and Mother Sati was the daughter of Daksha but Mother Gauri is the rebirth of Sati who was the daughter of Mena and Himavān.Note: Maa Gauri is the main goddess in Shaktism and Shaivism and it is believed that Maa Gauri is the source of all gods and goddesses but the truth is that Uma is also a form of the same Supreme Goddess Lakshmi so there is no difference between Lakshmi Saraswati and Uma.

In terms of Scandinavia in total the christianization took roughly 600-700 years from the 8th century to the 14th century although isolated areas were pagan up until the industrial revolution in the 19th century like Dalarna in northern Sweden. Likewise it is highly likely that the beliefsystem survived as a folkreligion practiced in private in most of Scandinavia. The more isolated the area the more likely but the population centers would've been effectively Christian first in Denmark since we are the landbridge to Scandinavia. It's also almost without a doubt that Scandinavian pagans were aware of Christianity already before 400AD. As the Roman emperor Constantine had christianized the empire with the edict of Milan in 313AD spreading Christianity throughout central western and southern Europe and North Germanic tribes already had trade routes throughout Europe evident by the amount of Baltic amber that has been found across the world already during the Bronze age.,Mikkel Lykholt,https://www.quora.com/profile/Mikkel-Lykholt-1

There is no self-proclaimed Prophet sent from God no single Rule Book. It is a Philosophy and knowledge written in the form of Shastras Puaranas and Vedas. For Example: In the Science Museum at Kurukshetra Bharat/India (One of the Holy places for Hindus) there is a display which shows that In ancient times we used to believe that the Solar eclipse occurs when Rahu (The Demon) eats the Sun. The very next display portraits the scientific astrological diagram of the Sun Earth and Moon explaining the real cause of the solar eclipse.This information challenges our elders’ knowledge about solar eclipse but we don't feel offended because we know and understand that our elders didn't have this information. But if you dare challenging the same to especial religions most of them outrightly denies this even today when cars are driving themselves (before women could in some very special nations). And we know the fate of Galileo. If not please google “Why was Galileo was jailed"". Hinduism is an evolution of knowledge. Our Vedas & Puranas contain knowledge & spirituality not religion or rules. Veda is Sanskrit word which literal translates to knowledge. Which evolves with time. Scholars used to updates it with every new information. We Hindus still live in that frame and don't follow or agree which doesn't fit in current time or society. That's why Hindus are so flexible with new things and culture. This is why we always welcome new technologies and other religions oppose even loud speakers. It can't be compared with fantasy books. People have created the religion out of it to suit their agenda be it Indians or be it Abrahamic followers. The word “Hindu” was used as a geographical identification of “People who lived (still live) near Sindhu river (Hindu{Persian dialect})/ Indus (Indoi{Greek dialect}=India)”. We never gave ourselves a name outsiders gave us. Religions that were created among ourselves are Buddhism Jainism Sikhism all are having rule books and these religions are not praised by actual intellectuals because all of these religions (including others) defies the Vedas (knowledge) and proceed towards pretentious behavior and false pride. Some fraudsters became so lame that they chant some mantras or abra ka dabra to make someone’s fate good or bad/to flee ghost for money or fame. One infamous myth about Hinduism is that it had caste system. It doesn't have a caste system but the class system. E.g. Brahman means who have knowledge of Brahm (Educated). Anyone can become Brahman or anyone can become Shudra (Uneducated) Kshatriya means fighters (Police Army etc.). Caste/class is not bound by birth but by work and profession. Today Govt. and Private jobs have the same class system known as Group A B C and D respectively. Again Hinduism is not a religion So there is nothing to convert to. If you really want to become a Hindu just read a lot and gain knowledge and contribute to society for the welfare of everyone. Whatever it may be science maths geography philosophy spirituality space computers or science. There is no foundation. Just evolve and dedicate your life to other living beings (if you want to). Comment Question(Collapsed Now): How would you scientifically explain Shiva Ganesha Krishna Saraswati Laxmi Durga Kali etc. ? Shiva A God of Destruction Kali Goddess of Death Krishna God but in Human form (To teach Dharma {not religion} to judge/choose what is right and what is wrong according to situations/time) Laxmi Goddess of Prosperity (You can’t offer pooja to Laxmi only you need the Lord Ganesha God of Wisdom along with her indicating that money/prosperity is useless without wisdom) Durga Goddess of War (willing to unleash her anger against wrong violence for liberation and destruction to empower creation{Copied form Wiki}). These are all the essence and characters we all have in our nature which we (our ancestors) explained to them in the form of god so our puny minds can understand them eagerly fast. None of the Hindu God commands you that how to worship them or worship them at all. We worship them because we respect whatever they are representing. We Hindus worship everything who gives/teaches us anything. We don’t worship only Cows(which is overrated) but Monkeys Rats Snakes Elephants Peacock Lions Tigers Nandi-The Bull Rain Sun Moon Universe Trees Sea Rivers light even death is celebrated when someone dies if he/she sees his/her fourth generation. We even worship TV computers cars motorcycles trucks planes before launching them for their parts and givings in our lives. My mother even worships a road (Choraha-4 way road) on various occasions And the list goes on. One finest example I can give is: There is a Shri Krishna Sangrahalya (Like Krishna Museum) very next to the science museum in Kurukshetra which I mentioned above. There are so many old statues and scriptures from ancient times in the Museum relating to Krishna but not one thing is there to tell you how/when/if to worship Lord Shri Krishna. In short we respect him for his teachings not because we fear him. Example 2: There are many temples of different Gods in Bharat but you can also find temples of movie/film stars e.g. Amitabh Bachchan Rajnikanth. People worship them because these actors have given tremendous performances in the movies (in Positive roles) and have become an idol for their worshippers. Example 3: Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam A Muslim has made its place in Hindu temple beside Gods by dedicating his life for Bharat. We worship him. I’m going to share something which I copied a long time ago from Quora. It’ll further broaden your knowledge about Hinduism. I hope the original answerer won’t mind because I’m spreading his thoughts/teachings. All thanks to him.

Previous day there will be holika dehan puja. Next day morning there will be devi pujan. After offering prasad to the deities cooking of various dishes will start like gujiya malpua puri homemade ice-cream etc. After the cooking all the ladies and children of the house will gather in our verandah to play with colours.Here is a pic for reference of how we play holi in morning. We play with gulal and ballons filled with coloured water.In the evening we play with abeer. We have this ritual of children touching the feet of elders with colours. This has continued since generations. We cousins will eat the snacks prepared and have a small get together session. Generally the celebration for holi starts from 6:30 in the morning to 10 at night. The festival of colours is celebrated in this way in our house. The kids of the house complain that why they get to celebrate this day only for one day though😊 All in all its fun to celebrate with family.

All who worship God with faith and devotion - whatever form it might be - and whatever religion they follow - they all come to him alone. But the devotees who love him personally and worship him directly - they are closer to him and he to them. As regards Shiva - Arjuna asks a question:-10:17. O Almighty Lord how can I a Yogi know You by constantly meditating on You? And in what forms are you to be contemplated upon by Me.Krishna answers giving all his outstanding manifestations forms and principles in which he can be contemplated upon by Arjuna.

One of the 12 holy Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva is in Jyotirlinga here in Somnath. The Somnath temple also called Somanātha temple or Deo Patan is a Hindu temple located in Prabhas Patan Veraval in Gujarat India. It is one of the most sacred pilgrimage sites for Hindus and is believed to be first among the twelve jyotirlinga shrines of Shiva. The temple was reconstructed several times in the past after repeated destruction by multiple Muslim invaders and rulers notably starting from an attack by Mahmud Ghazni in the 11th century. It is unclear when the first version of the Somnath temple was built with estimates varying between the early centuries of the 1st-millennium to about the 9th-century CE. The Somnath temple was actively studied by colonial era historians and archaeologists in the 19th- and early 20th-century when its ruins illustrated a historic Hindu temple in the process of being converted into an Islamic mosque. After India's independence those ruins were demolished and the present Somnath temple was reconstructed in the Māru-Gurjara style of Hindu temple architecture. The contemporary Somnath temple's reconstruction was started under the orders of the first Home Minister of India Vallabhbhai Patel and completed in May 1951 after his death.

Its recital is designed in such a manner one starts with Bala Kandam (chapters of birth) on Day 1 and ends on 31st day of the month by reciting the last line of Uttara Kandam (the later chapters) with a daily recital of a part of it for around 30 to 60 minutes per day.The holy Adhyathma Ramayanam a common spiritual book found in most of the hindu homes in Kerala. Its one of the most celebrated classics of Malayalam literature. Its recited by some member of the family mostly elders in morning hours after lighting the Nilavilakku (the sacred lamp). All temples also have similar process while almost of the radio stations and television channels do dedicate one hour slots in mornings for Ramayanam recitals. Its a much celebrated ritual across Kerala along with other traditions associated with this month. Why so? Well the primary reason is Nature Kerala records highest rainfall during the months of June-July. The monsoons officially start in Kerala by last week of May and takes its fiery form by third week of June. In July the intensity of rain may reduce but essentially it will be continously raining. The extreme rains in month of June will start flooding most of the rivers. This means by July most of the rivers will be flooded. People can’t move out or have an active social life in this period. Equally its a time when waterborne diseases spreads around like epidemic. Its common to have fever and other illness in this period. And in olden days its a time of food scarcity due to lower production of food in this period. So generally this month is often called as Panja Masam (Month of Miseries) in olden days. And as its a miserable month people resort for spiritual solace by reading Ramayana.When it rains terribly and one gets confined to 4 walls of home with all miseries naturally there is no other better work than Ramayana to give a spiritual comfort.  Why Adhyathma Ramayanam?Recital video of first chapter of Adhyathma Ramayanam Adhyathma Ramayanam was the first major literary work of 16th century to written in simple Malayalam by celebrated Malayalam poet- Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunchaththu_Ezhuthachan ]. Its the Malayalam translated version of celebrated medieval era Sanskrit text on same name- Adhyathma Ramayana [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhyatma_Ramayana ]. Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan is often called as Malayala Bhashapitavu (Father of Malayalam Language) for his contribution in converting Malayalam script to Gantha script instead of then the common Vattaezhuthu script. And it was this epic that set new standard in Malayalam literature by adopting a simple Malayalam which commoners can understand instead of highly classical Manipravalam [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipravalam ] texts which were used for literary works before it. Adhyathama Ramayanam was composed in Killipattu [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilippattu ] style (Parrot Song) which had its own charms in narration as the lyrics were focused more on sound effect of the poems which soothes one’s mind while listening instead of traditional kind of monotonous poem recitals. There is one more major reason why Adhyathama Ramayanam has over other spiritual texts. While its in simple malayalam which is easy to understand it also has several contexts that differ from original Valmiki Ramayana. Valmiki Ramayana focused itself as a story of a Human prince called Rama and the ordeals he faced while keeping himself as the most ideal Human being. Adhayathama Ramayanam changed the concept of Rama more as an incarnation of Lord Vishnu with a divine halo instead of a human being. Infact he is much like how Krishna is depicted in Mahabharatha (with a divinity). So unlike original Adayathama Ramayana has several contexts or situations where Rama preaches spiritual values and philosophies to Lakshmana and Hanuman. In this work Rama is a spiritual teacher and there is a portion called RAMA GITA [ http://www.mantraonnet.com/ram-gita.html ] (the song of Rama) much similar to Bhagavat Gita concept in Mahabharat. Rama gita is a portion where Rama explains the spiritual context of identity of Lord Vishnu and the secret of life to Lakshmana. These concepts are essentially part of original Sanskrit Adhayathama Ramayana as well as in the Awadhi work- Ramacharitamanasa of Tulsidas but Ezhuthachan simplified the highly complex Rama gita essence in simple concepts which ordinary people can related in day to day life. This marked difference makes Adhyathama Ramayanam a much easier and simpler spiritual text for one to find spiritual solace in times of grief and misery. As Rama himself has faced all miseries of life it simply helps commoners to co-relate.  Traditionally Ramayana Parayanam (Recital of Ramayanam) was mostly an upper class trait. Its used to a mandatory rite among upper caste Hindu families to read Ramayana during this month as well as in times of distress (Ramayana is often read in times of mourning when the body of deceased is brought to home for final rites and prayers). One must understand its not read out of any special devotion to Lord Rama as Rama isn’t a popular god for Hindus of Kerala.

Which temples in India performs tantric practices?,https://www.quora.com/Which-temples-in-India-performs-tantric-practices,https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9b69f3618b0ff122e448bdbc74aee377-lq,Most North Indian temple rituals are conducted according to the Puranas and they are referred to as mandir. In a mandir you do not have to have a specifically consecrated temple priest (dīkṣita arcaka). Anyone from any community men women gender fluid race or caste is entitled to perform puja - with the scantiest amount of training - known as a pūjāri or pūjarinī. All South Indian temples are built managed and have their rituals performed according to the Āgamas/Tantras. In these temples built according to strict rules and measurements of Sacred Architecture the ceremonies can only be performed by special priests - males and brahmins (some non-brahmins are now being trained to serve in the temples.) The priests undergo several years of training in the Tantric rituals as young lads and are then formally initiated into the temple priesthood through maṇḍala dīkṣa rites. Once thus consecrated they take up service in one of ālayas — technical word for a “Tantric” temple. As a clarificatory note for the uninformed; TANTRA simply means tanayati jñānam anena iti tantra. “Tantra is that (system) by which knowledge is spread.” The Saiva and Vaishnava canon of Tantra are called Āgamas and those of the Goddess are referred to as Tantras. Both terms are interchangeable. The Tantrik path is bifurcated into Right-hand Tantra (dakṣinācāra) and Left-hand (vāmācāra - Vamachara - Wikipedia). Right-handed Tantra or more specifically Āgama is patriarchal orthodox conventional and symbolic in its usages and practices and dedicated only to universal well-being. Left-handed Tantra on the other hand is matriarchal heterodox transgressional in practice and inverts and subverts all the “brahminical” norms and structures and social values.Diagram of an Ālaya.,Rami Sivan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Rami-Sivan

The language is simple easy to understand and fast moving Once you will read this book your several myths created by the TV serials face book fan groups modern day retelling would break like anything.Once you have gained interim knowledge of the Mahabharata and if you want to be an advanced learner go for:Bibek Debroy’s BORI critical edition Mahabharata- It is available in 10 volumes on Amazon. BORI is name of an institute (under a programme of Indian government which went for decades) which scrutinized all possible available 1259 Mahabharata manuscripts in the Indian subcontinent. They weeded out several interpolations or popular but fake stories. The language is difficult on several instances and it would require huge passion of the reader to go through it. Every volume has nearly 550 pages describing every duel between primer characters with best possible details. For an example one of its volume has three day of Mahabharata war explained in 550 pages. Every volume would cost around 350-450 on Amazon. This would book could be used as reference when two parties are arguing on Mahabharata content.Another book giving a contest to BORI’S Mahabharat is KMG Mahabharat- Kisari Mohan Ganguli’s Mahabharat. This is also an unabridged version means tale with no fictional/unaltered subject. The text of this book is also available on internet as a free domain. Its language is also tough on most of the occasions.Now for people who like reading fiction in the name of Mahabharata or those who perceived that Akbar was like Hrithik as shown in Jodha Akbar movie. Or Ranvir Singh and Shahrukh Khan as showcased in Bajirao Mastani and Asoka respectively were Bollywood lovers nor ferocious warriors could go for this popular category. It includes re-telling or Mahabharata from the lens of one character. Jaya Karna’s wife Palace of illusion and many are all very popular books. The authors have great writing style which suits their agenda and skill set to create entertainment while reading these fiction books in name of re-telling the Mahabharata. Note- they are not at all any where near to authenticity however face book fan clubs continue to take reference from these categories of books/fiction novel to glorify their hero or demean other characters.Honorable mention- If you want your kids to learn about the enchanting knowledge of epics please go for Amar Chitra Katha’s Mahabharat. It has 3 books set which cost around 2000. I have recently bought for my kids and it’s great to generate interest in our rich Hindu culture.

Is astrology really worth believing?,https://www.quora.com/Is-astrology-really-worth-believing?no_redirect=1,https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1ee87e4294d1cd8560db4d0a7f1f0d18,"In a word NO.For more information Google planetary precession.The ecliptic or the path of the sun as it's perceived from the revolving Earth passes through the constellations that formed the Zodiac: Aries Taurus Gemini Cancer Leo Virgo Libra Scorpio Sagittarius Capricorn Aquarius and Pisces. Astrologers skip a 13th constellation that also resides on the ecliptic: Ophiuchus. Babylonian astrologers and later the Greeks originally determined Zodiac signs by which constellation the sun was ""in"" on the day you were born. Early astronomers observed the sun traveling through the signs of the Zodiac in the course of one year spending about a month in each. Thus they calculated that each constellation extends 30 degrees across the ecliptic. Ancient astrologers grouped the 12 signs according to the classical elements. The elements represent personality traits and are used in conjunction with the star signs as well as with the position of the sun moon and known planets at the time to determine a horoscope. Fire — Aries Sagittarius Leo (spontaneous and impulsive) Water — Cancer Scorpio Pisces (imaginative and emotional) Air — Libra Aquarius Gemini (quick and animated tendency to intellectualize feelings) Earth — Capricorn Taurus Virgo (quiet and slow reactions slow to change emotionally) However a phenomenon called precession has altered the position of the constellations we see today and has resulted in a shift of the zodiac constellations. Precession and astrology The first day of spring in the Northern Hemisphere was once marked by the zero point of the Zodiac. Astronomers call this the vernal equinox and it occurs as the ecliptic and celestial equator intersect on approximately March 21. Around 600 B.C. the zero point was in Aries and was called the ""first point of Aries."" The constellation Aries encompassed the first 30 degrees of the ecliptic; from 30 to 60 degrees was Taurus; from 60 to 90 degrees was Gemini; and so on for all 12 constellations of the Zodiac. Unbeknownst to the ancient astrologers Earth continually wobbles around its axis in a 25800-year cycle. This wobble — called precession — is caused by the gravitational attraction of the moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. Over the past two-and-a-half millennia this wobble has caused the intersection point between the celestial equator and the ecliptic to move west along the ecliptic by 36 degrees or almost exactly one-tenth of the way around to the border of Pisces and Aquarius. This means that the signs have slipped one-tenth — or almost one whole month — of the way around the sky to the west relative to the stars beyond. For instance those born between March 21 and April 19 consider themselves to be Aries. Today the sun is no longer within the constellation of Aries during much of that period. From March 11 to April 18 the sun is actually in the constellation of Pisces! Wobbly Earth Means Your Horoscope Is Wrong",Alan Low,https://www.quora.com/profile/Alan-Low-4

The term originates in their own shastras e.g. Bhagavad Gita Bhagavatam Vedas etc. Sri Krishna refers to it.The followers of that dharma are also variously known by several other names that they self-identified with: Aryas and Arya-putras those who come from Arya-Vartha (greater India) those who hail from Bharatavarsha (again greater India in today’s geographical terms) Bharatiyas (those who hail from the lineage of the rule of Bharata) Bramha-Vartha etc. Why do none of these sound like “India”? Because “India” was a name given to us by the Greeks. Our own self-identity is not “India” — it is Bharatiya or any of the names above. In my heart of hearts I am not an Indian — I am a Bharatiya who follows Bharatiya samskriti. The word Hindu is used interchangeably in two ways which confuses a lot of people. Hindu (originally) is a geographical and cultural identifier of “those people beyond the Sindhu-Saraswathy river who share a common culture and common set of spiritual practices” … it was a reference to the Vedic civilization by foreigners i.e. those who traded with us called us ‘Hindu’ due to lack of certain sounds in their spoken language so the people of the Sapta-Sindhu (7 rivers) became Hapta-Hindu. This heterogenous group called Hindus included both Astikas (followers of the Vedas) and Nastikas (those who rejected the Vedas but shared almost everything else). The Astika group above are the people who mostly call themselves “Hindus” today when someone asks what religion are you? For lack of precision and a better way to explain who they are — in reality no one today has a clue about real world history only the manufactured and selective world history that is entirely euro-centric — so going around explaining what I just did is likely to fall on confused/deaf ears and lead to an infinite chain of questions. So “Hindus”.Figure: Sri Adi Shankara (Shankara BhagavadPada) who preserved/revived the ancient dharma which was under threat from various Nastika influences at the time by establishing maThas at the four corners of India all before the age of 32. He had mastered the Vedas and Vedangas at the age of 3 or 4 and by the age of 8 was writing extensive commentaries on advaitam in Samskritam. He is considered the avataara of Lord Shiva himself. He traveled on foot to the four corners of Bharatavarsha to establish the maThas/peethas that would serve as institutions to preserve the Astika sampradayas. Each institution had its own maThadhipathi who was responsible for each portion of Bharat under their guidance/protection. Shankara laid the foundations that would preserve the sanatana dharma for the next 1000 years of continuous onslaught by invasionary forces. This in concert with the continuous avataras (births) of mahapurushas (Sages Munis Siddhas Yogapurushas Bhaktas etc.) in every century from the time of Shankara Bhagavadpada has served to rejuvenate and preserve the momentum of the dharma over several generations and lifetimes preserving the practice of our dharma in its original form through the modern age. Of course under the umbrella of the Astika umbrella there are many darshanas (from ramanujam dvaitam madhvam samkhyam advaitam) each of which have their own peethas and maThadipathis etc. all of whom have contributed in various ways to the preservation of the continuity of the dharma over the millenia. However the Astika marga darshanas (paths) all fall under the umbrella of Sanatana Dharma. The Nastika darshanas do not. Astika means those who accept the Veda pramana (authority/evidence of the Vedas that That [Bramhan][paramatma] exists.). The greatest problem I have in describing these people who have taken birth and saved sanatana dharma over the millenia is in conveying just how extraordinary these individuals were. You are all familiar with the genius of Ramanujan and his importance in the world of mathematics. Imagine the genius of Ramanujan x 1000. Each of these spiritual giants had that big of an impact on the Bharatiya culture over these millenia. They saw and interacted with the devas/devatas they wrote copious philosophical treatises having such extraordinarily deep insights into the nature of reality in the form of the most devotional heart-rending poetry ever written and have revolutionized each generation going back for several thousand years. Incomparable geniuses who had direct realization of the highest truths coming from very different and disparate backgrounds — along the spectrum of paths described by Sanatana Dharma: bhakti karma and jnana margas. Each one of these people moved mountains so to speak. Their works and their legends have made their way into the smallest hamlets and villages in every corner of Bharatavarsha which is what makes this country so spiritually vibrant. People around the world are fascinated by SadhGuru for instance; but they don’t realize or know that we [Sanatana Dharma followers] have had/seen 1000s of such yogis siddhas bhaktas and other mahapurushas spanning generation after generation going back several thousand years. What SadhGuru is saying may sound original unique or different but that’s only because its the first time it is being heard in English. He hails from a very long tradition going back ages and those beings who took birth and had superconscious experiences all left their mark indelibly on this spiritual culture of Bharat. The world endlessly talks about Jesus and Mohammad thinking them to be unique or special in some way. We have had 1000s of spiritual giants (realized men women children) 10s of 1000s of miracles with 1000x more impact than either of those two that have revolutionized our culture for 1000s of years. Your 1 or 2 people with their fairly limited (and non-sensical) ideas hardly make a dent in our consciousness — one of the reasons why Christianity and Islam have failed to take hold in India for the last thousand years and why they never will. Our dharma has always thrived on the living Truth that takes birth time and time again to inject new life and momentum to a very ancient dharma. The difference is that the Abrahamic religions are good at marketing; we are not. I am not here to brag or gloat; what i’m trying to convey to you is that you have no idea that an entire alien race lives and breathes on the same planet as you do and have been for 1000s of years; because in your own self importance you think that you know everything there is to know — i’m telling you — what you know is hardly 1% of our civilizational history and its profound and deep impact. The “Hindu” world is so alien to the rest of these religions that truly it has no equal or comparable anywhere in the world. Indeed it is so humble and silent that it is easy to ignore and overlook — but it is everywhere and yet so silently nowhere. But its impact on this world would be earth-shattering if more widely understood.

While these religions are all based on the common framework of Shruti Smriti and Samhita individual rosters of scriptures vary widely. This is why it is plainly erroneous to judge the attitude of the 'Hindu' purely by studying the mythology. (This is also why I did not merge this question with What are your views on the women's role in the Indian mythology? which I've already answered.) That said I'd like to make one important observation about the treatment of women in 'Hinduism' viz. A lot of people claim that because we worship female deities and consider all women as aspects of Devi Hinduism is automatically female-friendly. This idea is patently false. Let's take the supposedly ""most celebrated passage about women"" from the Markandeya Purana.Vidyah samastastava Devi vedahStriyah samasta sakala Jagatsu (Chandi XI.6) All lores are your aspects O Devi; Likewise are all women in the world (your aspects) endowed with various attributes.This verse is a textbook example of benevolent sexism and positive stereotyping of underprivileged categories. As many studies (such as The insidious (and ironic) effects of positive stereotypes and The Pain of Positive Stereotypes) have shown and I quote: (positive stereotypes of underprivileged categories) are at once both especially unlikely to arouse skepticism and emotional vigilance while also especially likely to produce antiquated and harmful beliefs towards members of the target  group (compared to both baseline conditions and exposure to negative  stereotypes) including beliefs in the biological (or “natural”)  underpinnings of group differences and ironically the application of  negative stereotypes.Or in simpler words positive stereotypes tend to be more readily accepted and ultimately lead to the propagation of negative stereotypes. As another author has opined: positive stereotypes strip people of their individuality and alienate  them for not meeting the standards that are imposed upon themEven when individual women are praised and worshipped practically all the praise given is of the ""You Are a Credit to Your Race"" and ""Madonna-Whore Complex"" variety.  In the examples quoted by Pradip Gangopadhyay below every single example is built on the assumption that All Women Are Lustful. The lady who wants to remain a woman does so because sexual intercourse is more pleasurable in the female body. The woman who claims to be her own mistress appears to Ashtavakra in the guise of a old but lustful woman who saysThe very deities of wind and fire and water or the other celestials O  regenerate one are not so agreeable to women as the deity of desire.  Verily women are exceedingly fond of sexual congress. Among a thousand  women or perhaps among hundreds of thousands sometimes only one may  be found that is devoted to her husband. When under the influence of  desire they care not for family or father or mother or brother or  husband or sons or husband's brother (but pursue the way that desire  points out). Verily in pursuit of what they consider happiness they  destroy the family (to which they belong by birth or marriage) even as  many queenly rivers eat away the banks that contain them. The Creator  himself had said this quickly marking the faults of women.The Pingala alluded to is a courtesan who ""liberates"" herself by abandoning her legitimate profession (and possibly starving in the process). The Sulabha spoken of is an exception not the rule. Sure all of these may be construed as praise for the individual women but it is given at the expense of an entire gender. As I've mentioned elsewhere every  outspoken heroine from Sita in the Ramayana to the Devi in the Devi  Bhagawata Purana uninamously says the same thing: ""I'm not like the  common woman (प्राकृता). How dare you compare me to the common woman?  Quelle horreur!"" Truth is whether we portray women as being ""more than human"" or ""less than human"" we are essentially saying that they are ""not human"". If anything the religions under the umbrella of Hinduism are more guilty of sexism due to their insistence on Devi worship.",Ishita Roy,https://www.quora.com/profile/Ishita-Roy-9

Durga is serene blissful and benign mother of her children. It is form which people look upon as their own mother and worship devotionally. Kali on the other hand is mad with rage inebriated and roams about stark naked in the netherworld. She destroys the demons and prevents them from destroying the humankind. In earlier days people were afraid of this frightening demon-like goddess. However with the coming of men like Ramprasad and Sri Ramakrishna the worship of Kali was popularised. Now under their influence many people worship her also as the benign mother. Thanks!,Mousumi Mishra,https://www.quora.com/profile/Mousumi-Mishra-15
Do Christians see Hindus as pagans?,https://www.quora.com/Do-Christians-see-Hindus-as-pagans,,Yes Hinduism would fit the definition of pagan very well. The word “pagan” means a country religion based not on the revelations of prophets but on a cultural tradition going back into the mists of time with many sources and many gods of different natures. Which to me suggests that Hinduism is by far the biggest and most successful pagan religion. Of course the word has dismissive overtones.

Who invented Sanatana Dharma?,https://www.quora.com/Who-invented-Sanatana-Dharma?no_redirect=1,,NOBODY at all! Sanatana Dharma means the universal law that is the eternal truth. Who invents the truth? Like who invented the universal principle that the sun rises in the east? Nobody! Who invented the universal law of gravity? Nobody! Sanatana Dharma is as fundamental and universally applicable as the law of gravity. It has always been there just like gravity and the sun. There is no founder in the sense of a prophet or saviour. There is founding date either. There is no human CEO in terms of a pope or imam managing the business of how to popularise the religion with an increasing no. of followers through religious conversions brutality preying on the vulnerable and doing a whole lot of irreligious and unethical even tyrannical stuff to serve some political agenda of power hungry governmental set-ups. Sanatan Dharma is there just like the sun is there whether you like sunlight or not. The laws of Sanatana Dharma (like Karma) apply to you whether you like them or not whether you label the language of a Christian or a Jew etc. because they are the universal truth. Even if you like to stay in the air you will certainly be pulled back to the ground because of the law of gravity no matter how high you jump isn’t it? Just apply the same principle for the sake of comprehension to Sanatana Dharma. You don’t need to be baptised or circumcised to follow Sanatana Dharma. If you are born in this Mrityulok (earth) it is because of the law of Sanatana Dharma no matter what anyone tells you. That is simply the universal truth.,Radha,https://www.quora.com/profile/Radha-450

They shouted his boat to stop since it was a government boat. My father stopped the boat and asked them about the reason for their request. These people told him that they have been force fed beef by Muslims and as a result they have become Muslim. They didn’t want to become Muslims but they didn’t know how to come back to Hinduism. My dad told them to immediately bathe in Ganga if they wanted to become Hindus since the Ganga water can absolve anyone of all sins. The crowd believed him and bathed in the Ganga river and became Hindus again. This is a true incident. Only you can answer if eating beef will make you a non-Hindu. If you know the real spiritual basis for the ban on eating beef then you will most likely not consider yourself a non-Hindu. You may read this answer to know what is the spiritual meaning of the ban on killing a cow. Pradip Gangopadhyay's answer to Why are cows considered holy animals in Hinduism(sanatana dharma)? If you don’t know the basis of the ban then you may consider yourself a non-Hindu by eating beef and then bathing in the Ganga is always an option.,Pradip Gangopadhyay,https://www.quora.com/profile/Pradip-Gangopadhyay

However as per the Torah Solomon's Haykal could be re-built only by a Prophet who would be born amidst them. Jerusalem holds an important historical significance for the Christians since after being born in Bethlehem (Palestine) Jesus Christ was brought to Jerusalem where he lived and preached. Muslims attach importance to Jerusalem on account of the spiritual journey Isra that Prophet Muhammad had undertaken and also due to his changing the direction of prayer from the Ka’ba in Mecca towards Jerusalem for a temporary period. What bridges the gap between followers of these faith is that they have common Prophets. Hence from a historical perspective the Kingdom of Solomon and the birth place of Jesus Christ is indirectly significant to the Muslims.,Maulana Wahiduddin Khan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Maulana-Wahiduddin-Khan-1

Why are there many foreigners at the ISKCON temple?,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-there-many-foreigners-at-the-ISKCON-temple,,The Krishna Consciousness worship method is deep-rooted in Bhakti. It is Bhakti that gives Moksha or liberation as the goal. Even though Christianity doesn’t state it directly that faith is also based on Bhakti. It’s Bhakti that gives heaven or hell as the goal (in my understanding). In my view Bhakti appeals to those who follow Christianity. However the goal and methods of Bhakti as practiced by ISKCON seem more appealing to them than the methods and goals of Christianity.,SD Revive,https://www.quora.com/profile/SD-Revive

Since only 1 person has answered my question (and that too is a 1-line answer) I guess I’ll have to go ahead and speculate from what I can find online.After the historic judgement of the Supreme Court on the Babri Masjid-Ram Janbhoomi dispute some Hindus believe that other temples which were demolished to construct mosques deserve justice too. This was shared on the Indian right-wing space :The article mentions Ram Janmabhoomi Temple — Babri Masjid Kashi Vishwanath Temple — Gyanvapi Mosque Krishna Janmabhoomi Temple — Shahi Idgah Mosque Rudra Mahalaya — Jami Masjid Bhojshala — Kamal Maula Mosque Adinath Temple — Adina Mosque Bhadrakali Temple — Jama Masjid Vijay Temple — Bijamandal Mosque Somnath Temple and Several Hindu & Jain Temples — Quwwat al-Islam Mosque in Qutub Minar complex. While it is a good thing to know about one’s history I honestly don’t get the obsession of trying to “correct historical wrongs”. The gentleman who shared the article says that the only way forward is “legal reclamation” of the sites mentioned above; and it only means that he and the hundreds of people who upvoted it want temples to be restored there. And comments on social media sites would prove that they’re not the only ones who feel that way.Thankfully political leaders are more sensible and responsible than the average citizen:Replying to a query about whether the RSS would push “for Kashi and Mathura” now that the Ayodhya dispute had been settled by the Supreme Court RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat said: “The Sangh doesn’t get involved in any movement (andolan). We work towards character building. “In the past the circumstances were different resulting in the Sangh getting involved in the movement (Ayodhya). We will once again work for character building.”Source : RSS won’t push Varanasi Mathura mosque issues after Ayodhya verdict says Mohan Bhagwat,Deepak Purti,https://www.quora.com/profile/Deepak-Purti

Like we pursue different careers we could practice different religious techniques. The key is spirituality. Not the gods themselves. Religion was a personal belief. And it is not that Dharmic religions never had the divide with time the fractions of Shivate and Vaishnavites arose. But it doesn't matter. At crux of Vedas everything and everybody is a god. Religion is to worship and celebrate it. The rivers the mountains the winds the sun and the moon all are gods. You are god and so am I! Therefore never was religion propagated with whips. You chose it or you were born with it. Buddhism and Jainism were born out of spirituals among the dharmic yogis. They didn’t intend to preach religion but to preach principle and way of living. It was absorbed by India. Same about the Sikhs. None of these ever tried to convert by force. It is a matter of choice. How can I possibly force you to love my parents more than your own? In the end all lead to one. But Abhramic religions were propagated through force and material influence. Their rigidity has created a void among themselves. Though nothing should matter its all about personal faith. It should be the most private thing of an individual.

Just learn thisPrakriti = material reality and Purusha = spiritual reality Material reality is to please our five senses. Sight Hearing Taste Smell and touch are the five senses that we have. We work and do everything to please them. Every little and big thing you do in your life is to please one or all of these. From cleaning your house to visiting romantic places and tasting exotic foods.Apart from this material reality contains Art Music Sex Pleasure Prosperity etc. Material reality is impermanent; Sooner or later it withers away. Today you are eating the best food tomorrow you may have a great financial loss and you won’t be able to afford what you can afford now. With this there comes a stage where you become restless frustrated in pain anxiety stress fear and all sorts of emotions. So Now Prakriti = material reality = Unstable Purusha or spiritual growth is the ability to over the power of these emotions so that one has the wisdom to appreciate and enjoy all things material without getting needy or clingy So Now Purusha = Spiritual reality = StableOk I think you got the basic idea of Prakriti and Purusha. Now Think of our human body. The heart is on the left side so the side is unstable. and so that side i.e. the left side of a body is considered as Prakriti Side.So eventually the right side being stable is Purusha Side and that’s why told you to step the right foot first!,Amayra Sharma,https://www.quora.com/profile/Amayra-Sharma-17
Was beef eating common during the Vedic times in India and If yes how did it become sacrilegious over time?,https://www.quora.com/Was-beef-eating-common-during-the-Vedic-times-in-India-and-If-yes-how-did-it-become-sacrilegious-over-time,,"There are many beautiful answers already provided. I don't know anything about Vedas but I would like to share something i know about beef eating. First thing to be clear is that there is nothing sacrilegious about it If you know Hinduism deep enough and well enough you can see that there is no""Thou Shall not"" in Hinduism.  People in Ancient India always relied on improving Human Intelligence & Consciousness where they would naturally make good choices rather than simple belief systems that's the beauty of Hindu way of life and it should remain so.  Having said that it is to be made very clear that NO... it is not common in India to consume beef at all and it is indeed frowned upon why is that?.  REASON NO: 1 - BIG THREE In Indian culture we see Cow from mammals Snake from reptiles and Crow from birds as very close to human beings in evolution in terms of emotional display intelligence etc. Snake: Even now it is common that you don't kill a snake in India if you do you have to perform rites & rituals as you would do for a Human. Crow:Almost every form of rituals done to ancestors ends with an offering to a Crow. More recently you might have even seen videos from BBC on how intellectually capable a crow is. If not please see the following two videos  Cow:India which is largely an agrarian culture in the past relied heavily in the Milk Butter and other dairy products. All the homes gave individual names to the cows they reared and they are treated like a family member. A cow has a strong emotional display and shall actually shed tears if someone in the home dies or terminally ill etc. these incidences can be easily seen in rural areas. That's why Indians have a huge love for Cows in the same way many people love Dogs for it's emotional display. So Usage & Love for Cows is one of the prime reasons why Cows were not killed in India. Cow is a very versatile animal when alive almost everything from it can be used beautifully including it's dung & urine. Why we should just kill it for the meat? Ancient Indians were not stupid enough to kill the Goose that lays the golden egg. REASON NO: 2 - INDIAN FOOD CULTUREThe basic thumbrule of Indian food culture is that a Human being should consume food which is as far away from him as possible in evolutionary scale. i.e. it should start with Plant life then sea food then poultry then animals which are routed in the body and so on. (More in terms of Darwin's theory of evolution) This is the reason why even now over 40% of Indian are Vegetarian.Capability of a human being to digest the food will be much better if the food consumed is a simple life as opposed to a life which is higher up in evolutionary scale. There is another spiritual dimension to it which can be left out from this answer as it is not that relavant. That's why Cow is big 'No No' in India because it is seen almost as equal to Humans in terms of evolution. REASON NO: 3 - BASIC HUMANITY When we were born we drink milk from our Biological mother. When we grow up we mainly drink milk from the Cow. If we just drop all our belief systems conditions etc and just look honestly we can even say with gratitude that Cow is like a second mother to us. There are so many other options to eat & stay alive. The recent innovation in supply chain management is so good that we have managed to bring even Apples from halfway across the world to our doorsteps.  Is it really necessary to slaughter an animal which is versatile useful cries for you nourishes you in every way to satisfy your hunger? that's the basic question for which Indians say 'No it's not necessary' and they are labelled as fundamentalists.

In 8th century the devout Emperor Shomu and Empress Komyo ordered the whole nation to gather all their might and spirit to carry out the unprecedented plan of establishing a colossal statue of Buddha in the then Capital with a view to repelling the plague and famine that were devastating and afflicting the nation. Along with the assistance by Saint Gyoki the Imperial couple succeeded in the national project and even now the magnificent symbol of the crystallization of faith is ensconced in the holy town of Nara.,Takashi Takeuchi,https://www.quora.com/profile/Takashi-Takeuchi-3

It's very easy to please God Shiva  and he grants the desired boons to His devotees and at times invites trouble to himself. That is why Shiva is often referred as Bholenath the innocent God.There was an Asur named Vakrasur (Bhasmasur) he did years of penance to please Shiva and at last Shiva gives Darshan and tells him to ask for any desired boon. Then the asur says “ Hey Lord give me a boon such  my touch on any living being’s head should turn them into ash ! Shiva grants him the boon thus the Asur became Bhasmasura.

It's very easy to please God Shiva  and he grants the desired boons to His devotees and at times invites trouble to himself. That is why Shiva is often referred as Bholenath the innocent God.There was an Asur named Vakrasur (Bhasmasur) he did years of penance to please Shiva and at last Shiva gives Darshan and tells him to ask for any desired boon. Then the asur says “ Hey Lord give me a boon such  my touch on any living being’s head should turn them into ash ! Shiva grants him the boon thus the Asur became Bhasmasura. But that asur out of arrogance tries to test the authenticity of the boon on Shiva! ( the place where the Bhasmasura incident happened is Yana Karnataka).Then Lord Vishnu had to come in the form of mohini and put an end to Bhasmasura. This doesn't mean that Shiva can't protect himself. This shows his love towards his devotees and He never punishes them. Shiva destroys the arrogance / desires / lust in his devotees and thus dissolves them into Him. If Bhasmasura would have touched Shiva's head that asur would have turned into ash since Shiva is Rudra ( fire )  and no one can destroy or harm Shiva.Shiva always gives another chance for His devotees to change for the better  and live according to Dharma because Shiva can't be far away from his devotees for a longer time !There are many such instances  which proves Shiva's innocence.An asur named Vidhyunmaali asks God Shiva to be his body guard. And Shiva accepts that too. Then Mata Sati comes and seeing her ferocious form Vidhyunmaali frees Shiva from his word.Gajasur  a great devotee of Shiva asks Shiva to reside in his stomach. Shiva doesn't say no even to this wish and resides in Gajasur’s stomach. When Parvathi requests Lord Vishnu to get her husband Shiva back  Vishnu approaches Gajasur and brings back Shiva.When Ravana asks Shiva  to accompany him to Lanka and stay with him forever in Lanka  then Shiva goes in the form of AATMA Linga with Ravana. Then Lord Ganesh goes and gets back Shiva.This all shows only one thing Shiva follows only one protocol whatever his devotees ask will be granted and He can never say No to them !,Sunitha Parapatla,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sunitha-Parapatla

On that sight Yudhisthira was filled with rage. He asked the gods as to why the sinners were in heaven? He further enquired about his brothers and his beautiful wife. Narad muni who was present there spoke to Yudhisthira “ Oh son of Dharma! This is swarga. You should forget about your enmities from the mortal realm. The son of Dhritrashtra fought on the battlefield courageously and died like a warrior. As he died on the holy battlefield of Kurukshetra he deserves his place in heaven.” Yudhisthira still in a rage enquired about his brothers and all the warriors who died under his command. On hearing the words of Yudhisthira Indra asked a celestial messenger to guide the son of Dharma.Image courtesy: Google images The messenger walked out of the place on Indra’s command and Yudhisthira followed him. Soon they entered a region of darkness. Yudhisthira felt something bad about the place. As he walked further he could hear voices. Some were of animals and some were painful scream of humans undergoing torture. Deadly creatures and insects infested the place and a foul odour followed them everywhere. There were numerous corpses lying on the ground stained in blood. Each moment in that place was full of pain. There was no sign of life. There was no auspicious sign to heal a soul. The rivers were filled with blood and the trees had thorns instead of fruits. Yudhisthira asked the messenger where were they going? The messenger remained silent. He kept walking and hence Yudhisthira also followed in silence. After walking for a while the messenger stopped and looked back. He said” I have been permitted to come till here. I don’t have permission to go beyond. I should return. It would be best if you follow me and return back to our place.” Yudhisthira could not understand anything. He thought he was going to see his brothers and his wife. Instead he was at an unknown and inauspicious place. The messenger was ready to return. Yudhisthira also turned back to return with him. But then he heard cries coming from all directions. “Don’t leave us oh king! You have brought us an air of relief. Stay for a while.” Yudhisthira sensed the familiarity in those voices. He asked” What is this voice? Who are you? Why are you calling me?” Suddenly there were responses from all directions” It’s me. Draupadi” “ I am Bhima”…” I am Karna”. Yudhisthira was heartbroken. He screamed in pain” What kind of justice is this? Those sinners are in heaven and my beloved people are tormented in this hell” He turned to the messenger and shouted in angry voice”Go tell the gods I would not return. I will stay here with my people. If my presence could bring even a little relief to these pure souls I would bear this pain for eternity. Now leave!” The messenger returned and gave the message to Sakra (Indra). In a while all the gods along with Indra went to the place where Yudhisthira was mourning for his loved ones. At once the darkness disappeared and the foul smell was replaced by a heavenly scent. A divine presence occupied the whole place. Indra appeared before Yudhisthira with Dharma himself. Dharma spoke to his son proudly” Oh son! You have passed my test once again. You remember when you lied to Drona about his son Ashwatthama. Drona died because of your lie. You deceived him. That was your only sin my son! That is why you had to suffer this pain in hell. This was just an illusion to punish you for your sin. All beings must go to hell for their sins. Those who commit a lot of sin ascend to the heavens first so that they could live the fruits of their good karma before heading to hell. The souls who have lived their life righteously and did a small number of wrong deeds first go through hell to finally ascend to heaven.” Yudhisthira was relieved. He was taken by Indra in the different loks to show him where his brothers and kinsmen were? Indra told Yudhisthira” Your brothers have already paid for their sins and have attained high place in the heaven. Arjun is with Narayana himself. Bhima is with the Maruts. Nakula and Sahadev are with the Ashwins. The great Abhimanyu is with Soma (the Moon god). Karna is with his father Surya dev (the Sun god). Draupadi has submerged and become a part of Shree. All those who died in that war have attained their place in their respective worlds.” Yudhisthira also took his place in the heavens along with his father Dharma. So Pandavas didn’t go to hell. They attained hell for a short period of time as everyone is destined to go.,Khushboo Singh,https://www.quora.com/profile/Khushboo-Singh-946
How old is Earth according to Indians?,https://www.quora.com/How-old-is-Earth-according-to-Indians?no_redirect=1,,Surya Siddhantham (सूर्य सिद्धान्तं) is one of the most important texts that demonstrate how great and advanced the ancient Indian sciences are. The author of this book is unknown and it is said to be apaurusheya (अपौरुषेय) which means that it was not created by any human. Several interesting astronomical concepts such as determining the planetary positions the time of eclipses etc. are clearly described in this. The diameter of earth was described to be 16001600 Yojana (1600×8=128001600×8=12800 km). This value differs just 0.3% by the value calculated by today’s scientists. This error too may be because of taking Yojana as 8 kilometers which might be an approximation. The formula to find the area of circle was also provided as the square root of 10 multiplied by the diameter. (Today we use 𝜋π instead of 10‾‾‾√10. And 10‾‾‾√=3.16≈𝜋10=3.16≈π) So I am taking this great book as reference for my answer to this question. The following are some conversions of time according to this book. 11 Solar Year = 11 Divine Day360360 Divine days (or) 360360 Solar Years = 11 Divine Year1200012000 Divine Years = 11 Maha Yuga Maha Yuga is subdivided into 4 yugas in the ratio 4:3:2:1. The names and duration of each of these yuga are as given below. Satya Yuga = 48004800 Divine Years (0.40.4 Maha Yuga)Treta Yuga = 36003600 Divine Years (0.30.3 Maha Yuga)Dwapara Yuga = 24002400 Divine Years (0.20.2 Maha Yuga)Kali Yuga = 12001200 Divine Years (0.10.1 Maha Yuga) 7171 Maha Yuga are equivalent to 11 Manvantara. And in between every two Manvantaras there is a Manu Sandhi which is equivalent to Satya Yuga. 1414 Manvantaras along with the Sandhis form a Kalpa. There will be 1515 Manusandhis in a Kalpa which include 1313 in between 1414 Manvantaras 11 in the beginning and 11 in the ending. 11 Kalpa = 1414 Manvantaras ++ 1515 Sandhis = 14×71+15×0.414×71+15×0.4 Maha Yugas 11 Kalpa = 10001000 Maha Yugas Life span of Brahma (The creator): 11 Kalpa is equivalent to 11 day (or 11 night) to Brahma and Brahma has a life span of 100100 years of which each year has 360360 days and 360360 nights. Life span of Brahma = 100×360×2100×360×2 Kalpas= 100×360×2×1000100×360×2×1000 Maha Yugas= 7200000072000000 Maha Yugas Brahma’s present age: As of now 5050 Brahma years have been passed and of the 51𝑠𝑡51st year the first day is currently going on. As each day of Brahma is equivalent to 11 Kalpa this is the first Kalpa in the 51𝑠𝑡51st year. Out of the 1414 Manvantaras of this Kalpa 66 have lapsed and we are now in the 7𝑡ℎ7th Manvantara. Out of the 7171 Maha Yuga of this Manvantara 2727 have been passed and the present one is the 28𝑡ℎ28th. In this 28𝑡ℎ28th Maha Yuga the first 33 Yugas are over and this is the Kali Yuga. Time from the beginning of Kalpa till the beginning of this Kali Yuga: 66 Manvantaras = 6×71×120006×71×12000 = 51120005112000 Divine Years77 Manu Sandhis = 7×48007×4800 = 3360033600 Divine Years2727 Maha Yugas = 27×1200027×12000 = 324000324000 Divine Years11 Kruta Yuga = 48004800 Divine Years11 Treta Yuga = 36003600 Divine Years11 Dwapara Yuga = 24002400 Divine Years Total = 54804005480400 Divine Years = 5480400×3605480400×360 Solar Years = 19729440001972944000 Solar Years In the present Kali Yuga 51195119 years are over and the current one is the 5120𝑡ℎ5120th year. So the total years spent till now from the beginning of this Kalpa is 19729491191972949119 Solar Years. Time spent by Brahma for the creation: It took Brahma 4740047400 Divine Years in creating the entire planets stars gods and all types of living and non-living things. 4740047400 Divine Years = 47400×36047400×360 Solar Years = 1706400017064000 Solar Years So the amount of time after the creation is done = 1972949119−17064000=19558851191972949119−17064000=1955885119 Solar Years.

Narada asked “Oh Lord I have this question from a very long time. Whenever I come to see You You are always meditating. What is it You are meditating about all the time?” The Lord smiled and answered “I meditate on my dearest Lord Narayana. There is not one moment when I'm not thinking about my Lord. He lives in my heart and I worship Him every instance of time.” Narada then went straight to Vaikuntha where He saw Lord Vishnu lying in eternal tranquility on the bed of Adishesha serpernt. The Lord was in yoganidra state seeming to worship someone. Narada mesmerized by that sight asked “Oh Lord whenever I come to see You You are always in a blissful meditative state of yoganidra. What is it that You are thinking about all the time?” A pleasant smile got spread across Lord's face and He said “Oh great sage Narada it is my dearest Lord Shiva Who I always think about Who I always meditate upon. My Lord occupies my heart like the sunlight occupies the daytime skies.” That is why in Yajurveda we find following shloka. शिवाय विष्णु रूपाय शिव रूपाय विष्णवे |शिवस्य हृदयं विष्णुं विष्णोश्च हृदयं शिवः || यथा शिवमयो विष्णुरेवं विष्णुमयः शिवः |यथाsन्तरम् न पश्यामि तथा में स्वस्तिरायुषि|यथाsन्तरं न भेदा: स्यु: शिवराघवयोस्तथा|| It means that Shiva is nothing but Vishnu and Vishnu is nothing but Shiva. Vishnu lives in the heart of Shiva while Shiva occupies the heart of Vishnu. Just like Vishnu contains Shiva Shiva contains Vishnu. “Bring them to me those who forget this eternal unity” is said by Yama. A person will be safe and long living only if he doesn't find differences in Shiva and Vishnu. Lord Shiva is seen sitting on tiger's hide signifies His mastery and full control over animalistic qualities such as Greed Lust Ignorance and Anger etc. It also signifies that the Lord is Pashupati the Lord of all the animals. Om Namah Shivaya. 🙏🙏,Niranjan Daithankar,https://www.quora.com/profile/Niranjan-Daithankar

So the main tagline for the deities by their fans is that they are the saviours in Kaliyuga. In the case of Maṇikaṇṭha he is regarded as the incarnation of Śāstā in Kaliyuga so his relevance in Kaliyuga is emphasized.,Kiron Krishnan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Kiron-Krishnan-1

Are Sikh happy in India?,https://www.quora.com/Are-Sikh-happy-in-India,,Years ago a flock of sheep gathered on a Special day on the Request and Instruction of a Lion. He was great and Just. He fought for the Weak and helped the helpless even though he was a lion. He was soo devoted to making the world a better place that he showed the flock of sheep how to transform into a Lion. He asked for volunteers and made 5 sheep into Lions infront of the flock of sheep. Years passed by and those 5 lions became and 500 lions going to all corners of the country. More years slipped by and they became 500000 lions. They had to face many devils and foreign enemies but they did not give up. Like a lion they proved them selves the king of the Jungle and continued the path that had been started all those years ago. Equality and protection of the Weak. As more years came these lions started to go sleep. The Rage and spark of Justice was Lost. And then came a time when these Lions started to reduce in Numbers rather than increasing. These Lions were a Prestigious flock who somewhere have fallen silent. These Lions are called Sikhs. Are we Sikhs happy in India? I am. This is our Homeland. Our Guru's were born on this land our history was written on this land. Our 5 takhts are spread across India. There is no reason I or any other Sikh would have a problem with his own country. But is the condition of Sikhs Perfect in India not nearly. But that wouldn't make me unhappy with my Country. So what needs to be improved is the situation of Sikhs in India. All around the World other than India i see Sikhs doing soo much for the Religion which makes me wonder why can't we do the same in India.YouTube channelsOnline blogsFighting for Equal RightsGlobal RecognitionOnline Knowledge Websites and Apps.Why are soo many foreign living Sikhs contributing as compared to a very few number of Sikhs in India? There are a thousand more issues that can be approached in soo many ways. But the point ultimately remains the same. But we ourselves are to be blamed. I blame all Sikhs who aren't doing there part. Langar helping others fighting for others and equality have become terms only being used in discussion and not in real life. I used to think that Many Indians don't know about the Contributions of Sikhs for India and its people. But I was partially wrong. There are many who do know. But there are also many who are wrongly informed. I myself try to spread the right path of Sikhism as much as I can to as much people I can. Political Setbacks The Growth of Sikhism is partially to be blamed because of participation of Politics in Religion. Everyday newspapers are filled with political stories of Sikhs and Gurdwaras’. And none of this politics is concerned with the betterment of our Religion and Strengthening core values. It is also a shame that Canadian Parliament has more Sikhs than the Indian Parliament. Of course the Usual fight for Justice of 1984 riots still carries on till date. But it shouldn't hamper the protection of our culture and stop its growth. When it comes to Politics it doesn't limit itself to high level issues. There is a tendency today of communities to build as much Gurdwaras as possible. My sector alone has 3 Gurdwaras and another Gurdwara in a different sector a kilometer away hardly. I personally feel all that money could be used for increasing Sikh education and helping the society. India is perfect and Sikhs should be proud to be Indians. Of course there is some discrimination and issues that need to be tackled. But that is the responsibility of the youth to deal with. The Sikh Youth Needs to Rise from the Ashes and become Lions once again. Singh. If there is anything that happen which is against the Sikh ideology we must step forward and stop it. I am a Sikh and a Indian. Waheguru ji ka Khalsa Waheguru ji ki Fateh,Sukhbir Singh,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sukhbir-Singh-119

But if you see everything as equal then their would be no war etc. No greed etc. Too. The worship lets the worshipper focus the mind and remind him that everything is fundamental propert. Its just its kinda different method. Actually same is the reasoe Hindus worship idols. Since the ultimate reality can't be understood by mind so we assume that Ultimate reality in an idol and worship it. To understand what I have written.

Bollywood movies are always sensitive when it comes to serious topics. But sometimes for making comedy or just to make effective scenes reference of various characters from devotion is always first choice of almost every film maker. These scenes from movies have established very wrong shades about Hinduism. 1.Recent Bollywood movie named LOVE PER SQUARE FOOT Starring Vicky kaushal had a scene in a train.A couple had a conversation about public romance and suddenly both get out of control. Coming close to her the boy casually says something and kisses her lips.He says: “ Raghukul reet sadaa chali aai Pran jaye par pappi na jaye..” You are shamelessly doing something in public. That's another topic. But what's the meaning of using this line? These two lines represents the delight of Raghukul. It is still considered as a pride about lord Rama's family. It was their swore to do anything for fulfilling their promise. And now this prominent promise comes to pappi? Why? Didn't she let you kiss without conveying this cheap dialogue? 2. You are attending a grand marriage ceremony somewhere out of your country and still you have chosen Radha for dancing. It's superb to remember your culture. But wait what did you adnoun her? Sexy?Just because you are rich modern means you are allowed to humiliate pure souls by anyway you want? This is what our future generation will respect our goddess? 3. A guy from another planet fails to recognize the difference between actual God and a similar make up character. Okay!!!But was it really essential to make this guy run through gullys houses of people and even hiding below chairs of people? Making public laugh has came up to this extent now!!! 4. A leading lady from movie Lakshmi wouldn't survive in film if she was named something else? No! Her name had to be Lakshmi.5. Making use of love story of Radha-krishna is a separate topic in Bollywood. Almost each n every movie having lord Krishna focused on this topic only. It is true that this love Story Is a beautiful part of Krishna's life but it's a part only. Lord Krishna had some another shades than this. Even whole life of Krishna has multiple angles to showcase. But we are always watching him around Raadhika and making Raas-leela!!Along with thisthere are lots of examples from Bollywood movies which portrayed Hindu culture very wrongly. If it is about entertainment it is giving wrong message to world! But if you are aware of what you are doing then it is making a way to humiliate Hinduism. Movies are the most instant way whenever it comes to reference of any character. Bollywood movie makers should definitely understand future impacts of these things!

Why did the Romans and Arabs make their holy places in difficult to reach the places of their empires as against Indians who made holy cities in their population centers?,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Romans-and-Arabs-make-their-holy-places-in-difficult-to-reach-the-places-of-their-empires-as-against-Indians-who-made-holy-cities-in-their-population-centers,,Can’t speak for Arabs … though the holy sights of Islam weren’t made or chosen but are where they are because of historical events and their signficance. As for Romans — and Greeks … and most anyone else in the world who didn’t live in an alluvial flatland flanked by deserts — they built their chief urban temples on the city citadel for 2 pretty obvious reasons: (1) higher means closer to the gods/heavens — pity the poor Egyptians and Chaldeans who had to build their own holy mountains from scratch! — and (2) it’s the safest place if the city is attacked by an enemy. But that’s still in the middle of their cities. In fact the temple-palace-citadel tended to come first and city then grew up around it. So I don’t know what holy places you’re referring to. If there were any in hard to reach places it’s either because of some historical or legendary event with religious significance that happened there or because there was something truly wonderous to see there and they attributed religious significance to that.,Jack Wallace,https://www.quora.com/profile/Jack-Wallace-11
How is it possible that Hinduism has many gods and goddesses when in ancient times there were only three major gods (Brahma Vishnu and Shiva)?,https://www.quora.com/How-is-it-possible-that-Hinduism-has-many-gods-and-goddesses-when-in-ancient-times-there-were-only-three-major-gods-Brahma-Vishnu-and-Shiva,,Brahman is the source of not only Brahma Vishnu and Shiva but also of everything else. Brahman is the source of countless deities both major and minor. No one knows why Brahman is like that. Universe and gods and goddesses are manifestations of BrahmanThere are two states of this Brahma; one with and one without shape; one perishable and one imperishable; which are inherent in all beings. The imperishable is the supreme being; the perishable is all the world. The blaze of fire burning on one spot diffuses light and heat around; so the world is nothing more than the manifested energy of the supreme Brahma: and inasmuch Maitreya as the light and heat are stronger or feebler as we are near to the fire or far off from it so the energy of the supreme is more or less intense in the beings that are less or more remote from him. Brahma Vishńu and Śiva are the most powerful energies of god; next to them are the inferior deities then the attendant spirits then men then animals birds insects vegetables; each becoming more and more feeble as they are farther from their primitive source. In this way illustrious Brahman this whole world although in essence imperishable and eternal appears and disappears as if it was subject to birth and death. The supreme condition of Brahma which is meditated by the Yogis in the commencement of their abstraction as invested with form is Vishńu composed of all the divine energies and the essence of Brahma with whom the mystic union that is sought and which is accompanied by suitable elements is effected 7 by the devotee whose whole mind is addressed to that object. This Hari who is the most immediate of all the energies of Brahma is his embodied shape composed entirely of his essence; and in him therefore is the whole world interwoven; and from him and in him is the universe; and he the supreme lord of all comprising all that is perishable and imperishable bears upon him all material and spiritual existence identified in nature with his ornaments and weapons.Vishnu Purana I.22.55-65,Pradip Gangopadhyay,https://www.quora.com/profile/Pradip-Gangopadhyay

The son of Hidimba’s son quickly grasped a golden club and whirling it hurled it. However Drona’s son struck it with his arrows and made it fall down. At this Anjanaparva rose up into the sky and began to roar like a dark cloud. He showered down trees from the sky. Ghatotkacha’s son was versed in maya. But Drona’s son used arrows to strike him in the sky like the rays of the sun against clouds. He then descended and once again stationed himself on his chariot decorated with gold. Anjanaparva was as beautiful as a lofty mountain. He was clad in iron armour. But Drona’s son killed Anjanaparva the son of Bhima’s son like Maheshvara against Andhaka. Drona Parva: Ghatotkacha Vadha Parva: Chapter 1108(131)On the 14th night of Kurushetra war Ashwatthama killed many sons of Drupada and 10 sons of Kuntibhoja.There was an immensely forceful river of blood that was created by Drona’s son. Warriors lamented in loud tones. The wounds94 were the waves. That extremely terrible river flowed towards the ocean that was Yama’s eternal abode.‘“Having killed the rakshasas Drona’s son struck Hidimba’s son with his arrows. Drona’s immensely strong son was extremely angry. He again struck Vrikodara the Parshatas and the other Parthas with large numbers of iron arrows. The lord killed Suratha Drupada’s son. In that battle he again killed Shrutanjaya Suratha’s younger brother. O Indra among kings! Drona’s son slew Balanika Jayanika Jaya and Shrutaharya95 and sent them to Yama’s abode. With three other sharp arrows that were well tufted and garlanded with gold he killed the powerful Shatrunjaya and sent him to Shakra’s world. He killed Prishaghna and the insolent Chandradeva. He killed ten of Kuntibhoja’s sons with ten arrows. Drona Parva: Ghatotkacha Vadha Parva: Chapter 1109(132)On the 15th day of Kurushetra war Ashwatthama killed Pourava Chedi Prince and Malava chief Sudarshana in battle.Drona’s son used extremely sharp and yellow arrows in torrents and covered the front and the rear. The earth the sky the firmament the directions and the sub-directions were covered with these arrows which were terrible in form. He was fierce in his energy. He was like Indra in his valour. With three arrows that were released at the same time he severed the head and the two arms which were like Indra’s standard of Sudarshana who was stationed on his own chariot. He killed Pourava with a spear70 and used his arrows to shatter his chariot into fragments. With broad-headed arrows he severed his71 arms which were smeared with excellent sandalwood paste and his head from his body. The youthful and beloved prince of Chedi was like the blue lotus72 in complexion. Using supreme arrows that were like blazing flames of fire he73 laughed and pierced him dispatching him with his horses and his charioteer towards death. Having slain those two brave warriors in the battle the lord who was Drona’s son remained unvanquished and delightedly blew on his large conch shell. Drona Vadha Parva: Chapter 1148(171)On the 16th day of Kurushetra war Ashwatthama killed Pandya King Sarangadhwaja and the 6 maharathas who protected him.The head of Drona’s son was decorated with a diadem. It was decorated with supreme gems jewels and diamonds and adorned with excellent cloth garlands and pearls. It was as dazzling as the sun the moon the planets and the fire. Being severely struck198 it was shattered into fragments and fell down like a large forest when it is struck by the great Indra’s vajra or when The summit of a mountain falls down on the ground. At this he199 blazed with great rage like a king of the serpents that has been struck by the foot. He picked up fourteen arrows that were capable of killing the enemy and each of these was like Yama’s staff. With five he served the feet and trunk of the elephant and with three the king’s arms and head. With six he killed the six splendid maharathas who were following the king of Pandya. The king’s arms were long and smeared with the best of sandalwood paste. They were adorned with gold pearls gems and diamonds. Those arms of the king fell down on the ground and writhed around like serpents that had been killed by Tarkshya.200 His head possessed a face with the complexion of the full moon. His eyes were coppery red with rage and his nose was excellent. With its earrings the head fell down on the ground and was as resplendent as the moon between two Vishakhas. Karna Vadha Parva: Chapter 1164(14)On the 18th day of Kurushetra war Ashwatthama killed maharatha Suratha using his swift arrows.“O king! While all the kshatriyas looked on Bharadvaja’s maharatha son covered Sudharma with a storm of arrows. At this the Panchala maharatha Suratha attacked Drona’s son on his chariot making a sound like the roaring of clouds. He brandished his supreme bow which was firm and was capable of bearing all loads. He shot flaming arrows that were like venomous serpents. In the battle when maharatha Suratha angrily descended Drona’s son became wrathful like a snake that has been struck with a staff. His brows furrowed into three lines and he licked the corners of his mouth. He glanced at Suratha in rage and rubbed his bowstring. He shot a sharp iron arrow that was like Yama’s staff. It powerfully pierced and shattered his heart and then penetrated the ground like Shakra’s unleashed vajra. Slain by the iron arrow he fell down on the ground. It was as if an extremely large mountain top had been shattered by thunder. When that brave one was killed Drona’s powerful son supreme among rathas swiftly climbed onto his chariot.92 Shalya Vadha Parva: Chapter 1232(13)Apart from that Ashwatthama killed 1 Akshouhini sena of Ghatotkacha’s rakshasa army on the 14th night of Kurushetra war. On 15th day of Kurushetra war Ashwatthama slew 2+ Akshouhinis of Pandava army using Agneyastra and Narayanastra. Note: I m not including the massacre done by Ashwatthama on the 18th night after the end to the war because Ashwatthama was possessed by Lord Mahadeva.

The temple was rebuilt by the Ganga dynasty king Anantavarman Chodaganga in the 12th century CE as proposed by the Kendupatna copper-plate inscription of his descendant Narasimhadeva II. Anantavarman was originally a Shaivite and became a Vaishnavite sometime after he conquered the Utkala region (in which the temple is located) in 1112 CE. An 1134–1135 CE inscription records his donation to the temple. Therefore the temple structure must have started sometime after 1112 CE.According to a story in the temple chronicles it was founded by Anangabhima-deva II: different chronicles variously mention the year of construction as 1196 1197 1205 1216 or 1226. This suggests that the temple's construction was completed or that the temple was renovated during the reign of Anantavarman's son Anangabhima. The temple complex was further developed during the reigns of the subsequent kings including those of the Ganga dynasty and the Gajapati dynasty,Utkarsh Bitla,https://www.quora.com/profile/Utkarsh-Bitla

If Shiva is a destroyer God why do Hindus worship him? To answer this question first we should understand Who Shiva actually is. Before that please understand that the Supreme Gods that we talk of are the different concepts of this universe and those who are believed to be their human forms are the teachers who taught us those concepts. Lord Siva has two forms: Siva and Sankara; Siva being the divine concept and Sankara being the first teacher of the Shaiva concept. ‘Shaiva’ concept is all about ‘Mahakaal’ which means ‘The Great Time’. He is the personification of time. As time brings end to everything in this world this concept is called as the Lord of Death. ‘Time’ (Lord Siva) is the one who laid platform for everything to exist in this universe. He is the ultimate truth in life - death; which is delivered by time. He is the dark empty space (nothingness or darkness) that covers the major portion of the universe. In other words Shiva is the concept of ‘Space-Time’. So he is known as ‘Adi’ and ‘Anandh’; which means someone who exists from the very beginning and one with no end. He is the time and space which existed before the universe came in to existence and which will exist even after the universe ceases to exist. Sankara was called as the ‘Adi Sidhar’ which means the first teacher. He was a wanderer and spread the concept of Space-Time among the humans. He rested in burial grounds and rubbed ashes all over his body. He was a great dancer and educated the humans the art of dancing; which gave him the name ‘Nataraj’ – ‘The King of Dance’. He also taught the first form of Martial Arts which was known as ‘Kalari-Payatu’ to the Warrior Saint Parasurama who then taught it to the humans. Now you see the Hindus do not worship destruction but embraces the fact that death is the only truth in life which is sure to come. They believe in getting rid of their desires before the day they meet their ‘Kaal’ (Time) so as to die in Peace. They have learned the ultimate truth in life (Mukthi and Moksha) and thus do not take anything for granted. I would suggest you to read a book ‘A Quest For A Lifetime’ for better understanding of these concepts. Thank You.,Sunil Raveendran,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sunil-Raveendran-4

Disclaimer : My answer will be based strictly on the Vaishnav beliefs and Scriptures. before beginning the answer I Offer salutations to the lotus feet of my dear mother☺️No the opposite is true. Goddess Mahakali is a form of Maa sita. As per Sri Hanuman geeta and Adbudh Ramayana It’s maa sita who is the source of All Other shaktis be it Devi Mahakali or Devi mahalakshmi. As per the Adbudh Ramayana :“Sita is basically measureless and infinite(as the macrocosmic attributeless all powerful and majestic source of stupendous energy of creation) and she is without any blemishes taints faults and shortcoming . The cosmic divine energy called Shakti has its existence because of you (i.e. you are an embodiment of that energy as the cosmic Goddess) and your glory and radiance is as pure brilliant and shining as the splendour of the Sun.” [Reference : Canto 25 Adbudh Ramayana]Further Shri Ram said :“You are the Lord and unquestioned mistress of the realm (i.e. the entire creation). You remain in eternal and perpetual bliss which is everlasting. You hold an excellent trident in your hand. You embody all the Gods ; you are a personification of all the Gods as well as the supreme transcendental sublime and subtle Lord (called Brahm) who is the Lord of all Gods.” [Reference : Canto 25 Adbudh Ramayana]She assumed the Terrific Mahakali form to Slay the Extremely powerful demon called sahastravan the one who conquered not only the earth but also The heavens. As per Sri Ramcharitmanas She is the source of the Tridevis :As per Sri Sita upanishad/Adhyatma Ramayana /Adbudh Ramayana/Sri Ramcharitmanas She is the divine cosmic energy herself The energy of “Brahma” ( which is Shri Ram himself) and is the mool prakriti :Prajapati replied “Sita is a truthful manifestation of the divine cosmic dynamic energy of the supreme Brahm which is known as ‘Shakti’. Being the primary cause of creation and its manifestation as Nature she is called the ‘Mool Prakriti’ or the root from which this vast tree representing the multifaceted creation has not only sprouted forth but is also nourished by and empowered to develop into its fascinating colourful and enthralling form. Since the primary cosmic divinity called Pranav or Brahm represented by the ethereal monosyllabic Mantra OM is the basic foundation or seed from which Nature itself has emerged Sita is also synonymous with this Pranav which in turn represents the supreme transcendental and enigmatic Brahm.” [Reference : Sri Sita Upanishad Verse number 2]In Sri Hanuman geeta (a discourse By Her To God Hanuman) She says :""I am not outside him. His existence is not possible without me. I am his eternal power. Appearance of this phenomenal world is my luxury my pleasure. Millions and billions of cosmic universes emanate from me. I am the giver of birth and all creation the preserver and the nourisher of all good creation and destroyer of karma existence and worn out life in them all. The appearance of this mundane world is a vibration in power. And that power I am as well as the very vibrations themselves. And I am the power of this Sri Rama. Completely non-different from him. ""Imposed by me upon this Lord of my heart the Truth consciousness and bliss reflect back upon me and I shine as sandhini samvit and lhadini. Again these are potencies of the Lord of mine. Through vibrations of these reflections I introduce the transcendental worlds of Saketa Goloka Vaikuntha and so on. When the rays of their dazzle travel far below enveloped by my gross power they transform as satva rajas and tamas. From these comes forth the world. Thus the entire visible imaginable conceivable world is my sporty adventure.” [Reference : Sri Hanuman geeta]Here “His” refers to Shri Ram i.e the one who is the eternal Brahma The eternal Parambrahma and she herself is his power. She is the one Who powers all the Realms of the Gods including Saketa Goloka Vaikuntha Swarga etc And She is the one who is responsible for Destruction Creation and nourshing the universe alongside Shri Ram. Further :""This ever-changing phenomenal flux is the Mahakali form of Empress Sita. The world is the empire of death. Change is the process of death.” [Sri Hanuman geeta]sri Hanumanji wrote :“I make salutation to Sītā who is the ātmavidyā (the secret knowledge of the self and the self of self) who has three-fold-manifestations (Shri-Bhu-neela) who is (has taken form of) UmA (Parvati). Oh Śrī Sītā the dearest consort of Śrī Rāmachandra the divine-mother (origin and the cause) of entire cosmos the most beautiful ONE whose beauty can't be expressed in words I always worship You in my heart!” [Reference : sri Hanuman stuti]as per Laxmi tantra :She is the Ultimate refugee She is the Object of the Vedas and She is the Protector Of the Three worlds. Countless creations emerge from her womb only. From Sri Sita Sahasranam strotam She has been referred to as “Mahamaheswari” i.e the Supreme Mother Goddess which itself Makes her The source of All other shaktis. Further She is also called as “Manojawa” or the divine consort of Lord Vishnu (Goddess laxmi) and even as the one who Took the form of Consorts of Lord Shiva and Lord Brahama. She is also called “mahashaktiramanomai” i.e the great super power of creation possessing stupendous and unprecedented powerful energy the matchless authority that has effective punch and strength to do anything. As per Adhyatma Ramayana she is the controller of everything the Mool prakriti :“And you must recognise me (Sita) as the pristine sublime ‘Nature’(essential element and cosmic infinite creative energy) behind creation sustenance and annihilation. Indeed I create this delusionary world in conjunction with him (Sri Ram) without any let-up or indolence(i.e. I do it diligently and constantly) (34). Inspite of it the stupid and ignorant people charge him (i.e. allege him) of being the creator of this creation of mine which I have done myself by simply being near to him. So his taking birth in Ayodhya in the most pure clan of Raghu  then helping sage Vishawamitra by protecting his fire sacrifice liberating Ahilya from her curse and breaking the bow of Lord Shiva were all due to my influence or wish.” [Reference : Adhytama Ramayana]सत्क्रिया गिरिजा नित्यशुद्धा पुष्पनिरन्तरा । दुर्गा कात्यायनी चण्डी चर्चिका शान्तविग्रहा ६०० ॥ ९६ ॥ कल्याणी कमला रामा पञ्चभूतवरप्रदा । वाच्या वरेश्वरी नन्द्या दुर्जया ६३० दुरतिक्रमा ॥ १०० ॥ [sri Sita saharanam strotam] She is Goddess Durga She is Goddess katyani She is Goddess chandi and She is Goddess charchika She is kamla (Goddess laxmi) She is Kalyani and she is Goddess saraswati. Hence It’s now obvious that Mata sita is The Supreme cosmic energy She is the Parashakti of the Parabrahma [Lord Ram] from whom rest all other Shaktis emerge.Jai Maa Seeta _/|\_🌺🌺",Daśanāmi Vaiṣṇava,https://www.quora.com/profile/Da%C5%9Ban%C4%81mi-Vai%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%87ava

Mona Singh:- But Sushmita Sen (Miss Universe 1994) got such success. Her fate changed in a day. To which Akarsh Khurana (Dad) explained what overnight success looked like for Sushmita. Here is what he said she did/went through. She studied in a Hindi medium school till 16. After that she worked hard on her English skills. When everyone backed down listening about Aishwarya Rai being a participant too she stayed to compete. With all the courage. She did not have a designer gown for the event and got it stitched from some local shop. Neither she had hand gloves. In fact her mother used socks to make hand glove for her. Efforts of days and nights finally brought that night of ‘Overnight success’.In the age of quick fix and instant Maggi world we have forgotten that nothing good happens without patience. It requires years of inside work to celebrate what we see one day on the outside. You ask What is the synonym of magic? It surely has to be patience and perseverance.

It is predicted in the Kali Santarana Upanisad that within the 432000 years of our present most materialistic winter age of Kali there will be a 10000 year era like an Indian summer known as the Caitanya Era in which the entire planet Earth will become a spiritual paradise. That 10000 period began 500 years ago with the advent of Lord Krishna Himself taking the form of His own devotee Sri Krishna Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Therefore at the present time all the followers of dharma (spirituality) should spend their lives fully dedicated to the world deliverance mission of Lord Caitanya for expanding that spiritual revolution which is currently in a seed-like state into a full-fledged tidal wave which will completely spiritualize our modern day totally materialistic global society.

He is called as the 'King of Nagas'. He is a divine cosmic serpent. His power is literally beyond this Universe. There is no limit to his cosmic power. He possesses Infinite cosmic power. He is so powerful that he literally holds the entire cosmos on one of his hoods. The Universe is just a mustard seed in comparison to his physical form. Lord Anantha Shesha is endless. Even Lord Garuda who has enough power to bear the mass of three realms on one of his feathers couldn't find the end of his elder brother Adi Shesha. He is more than capable of bearing the mass of all the planets of the solar system on one of his hoods as well. First and foremost he is known to be the resting place of Maha Vishnu himself. If he is capable of holding a supreme being like Maha Vishnu then he is more than capable of bearing the mass of the entire Universe too. One important point to be taken into consideration is that Lord Adi Shesha is not just some devotee or servant of Maha Vishnu but he is an expansion of Maha Vishnu himself. Lord Adi Shesha is the partial manifestation of Maha Vishnu himself. Also Maha Vishnu and Lord Anantha Sheshanaag are inseparable. Maha Vishnu and Lord Anantha Sheshanaag are one and the same. So he is non-different from Maha Vishnu when it comes to pure spiritual energy. According to Hindu scriptures Lord Anantha Shesha is a time gap between the creation and destruction of the Universe. As long as Lord Anantha Shesha keeps on uncoiling time moves on forward and the creation takes place. If Lord Anantha Sheshanaag coils back the very next moment it will bring an end to the existence of this Universe. For instance even after the destruction of the entire Universe Lord Anantha Shesha will still remain intact without a scratch even after the entire creation is gone. As his name 'Anantha' suggests his power is Unfathomable.Jai Siya Ram 🙏 Jai Hanuman 🙏,Jalandhar Aggarwal,https://www.quora.com/profile/Jalandhar-Aggarwal

Here are some of his greatness. Fast of all let me ask you what makes a god the most powerful? Is it the ability to rule over a population? Is it to kill thousands easily? Is it to do magical manifestations? Well no. Her I will tell why Vishnu and his avatars are the most powerful. 1 . Vishnu took the form of a small fish called Matshya and grew so large that he carried a boat full of people to protect them from a great flood.Here Vishnu showed that powerful is one who protects people. 2 . Vishnu once took the form of Varaha (half man half boar). He killed a demon and lift the mother earth on his task to bring her out of water.Here Vishnu showed that powerful is one who has strength. 3 . Vishnu once took the form of an women called Mohini to slay a group of demons. He seduce the demons to distract them while the other Gods can take away the immortality potent.Here Vishnu showed that power is feminine who if wish can control everything even demons and males. 4 . There was another demon who is near invincible. He has a boon that no human or animal can kill him no weapon can kill him. he cannot be killed in day or at night. He cannot be killed on earth or in sky. In order to kill this demon Vishnu tookj the form of Narasimha ( half human half lion). Vishnu smartly planned a way. He took the form of an human animal hybrid use his claws took in his lap and killed him during the evening. So non of the boons were useful to the demon.Vishnu showed that power is smartness. 5. Vishnu took another form called Parasurama. He is a mere teacher and a hunter. Still he has the power to invoke weapons like nuclear bombs. 6 . The famous avatar of Vishnu is that of Rama. He was a king but had to go through a journey of hardship. He and his wife was exiled to forest for 14 years. His wife got kidnapped by demon Ravana. Had to fight with many demons in the forest. Had to war with Ravana to rescue his wife. Leave and exile his wife due to pressure of society. Leave a life without marrying second one.Vishnu here showed that power is the ability to endure pain. 7 . Finally Vishnu took the form of Krishna a mere cowherd. He slay numerous demons lift a hill on his finger plays flute. But the most important part is his involvement in the Great Mahabharata War. He use all his magic illusion tricks techniques politics manipulation love to kill evil. But he never use weapons or injustice for it. Vishnu here showed that he is the start and end. He is all god all demons he is time he is space he is the one.Here Vishnu showed that power is the ability to fight for goodness. So it is seen that Vishnu is powerful because he is calm smart can endure pain can manipulate can teach can guide can destroy evil no lust for material needs can love.My name is Satyajit Kalita Ceo and founder of blogging and photo sharing site Zobez (http://www.zobetoynpuzzle.com/signup.php ).

Which are the things that come under Sattvik Rajsik and Tamsik according to the Bhagavad Gita?,https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-things-that-come-under-Sattvik-Rajsik-and-Tamsik-according-to-the-Bhagavad-Gita,,Everything material in the universe comes under Sattvik Rajasik and Tamasik. These three modes make up prakriti which is the sum total of everything material. When these three modes are in perfect equilibrium nothing happens there is no activity. Then at the beginning of creation the desires of the living entity with the will of Maha-Visnu and the influence of time agitate the three modes and the entire creation unfolds from the subtle to the gross. There is always competition between the three modes. It can be visualized like a pie chart with shifting divisions. As the influence of one increases the other two decrease and then there’s a change and a smaller section increases and becomes bigger than the other two. In this way one or other is always trying to dominate. The effects of each of the modes is summarized by Krishna in one line.O son of Bharata the mode of goodness conditions one to happiness; passion conditions one to fruitive action; and ignorance covering one's knowledge binds one to madness. Bg 14.9This is a summary of the three previous verses. If you want more details then they are below.O sinless one the mode of goodness being purer than the others is illuminating and it frees one from all sinful reactions. Those situated in that mode become conditioned by a sense of happiness and knowledge. PURPORT The living entities conditioned by material nature are of various types. One is happy another is very active and another is helpless. All these types of psychological manifestations are causes of the entities' conditioned status in nature. How they are differently conditioned is explained in this section of Bhagavad-gita. The mode of goodness is first considered. The effect of developing the mode of goodness in the material world is that one becomes wiser than those otherwise conditioned. A man in the mode of goodness is not so much affected by material miseries and he has a sense of advancement in material knowledge. The representative type is the brahmana who is supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness. This sense of happiness is due to understanding that in the mode of goodness one is more or less free from sinful reactions. Actually in the Vedic literature it is said that the mode of goodness means greater knowledge and a greater sense of happiness. The difficulty here is that when a living entity is situated in the mode of goodness he becomes conditioned to feel that he is advanced in knowledge and is better than others. In this way he becomes conditioned. The best examples are the scientist and the philosopher. Each is very proud of his knowledge and because they generally improve their living conditions they feel a sort of material happiness. This sense of advanced happiness in conditioned life makes them bound by the mode of goodness of material nature. As such they are attracted toward working in the mode of goodness and as long as they have an attraction for working in that way they have to take some type of body in the modes of nature. Thus there is no likelihood of liberation or of being transferred to the spiritual world. Repeatedly one may become a philosopher a scientist or a poet and repeatedly become entangled in the same disadvantages of birth and death. But due to the illusion of the material energy one thinks that that sort of life is pleasant. Bg 14.6 The mode of passion is born of unlimited desires and longings O son of Kunti and because of this the embodied living entity is bound to material fruitive actions. PURPORT The mode of passion is characterized by the attraction between man and woman. Woman has attraction for man and man has attraction for woman. This is called the mode of passion. And when the mode of passion is increased one develops the hankering for material enjoyment. He wants to enjoy sense gratification. For sense gratification a man in the mode of passion wants some honor in society or in the nation and he wants to have a happy family with nice children wife and house. These are the products of the mode of passion. As long as one is hankering after these things he has to work very hard. Therefore it is clearly stated here that he becomes associated with the fruits of his activities and thus becomes bound by such activities. In order to please his wife children and society and to keep up his prestige one has to work. Therefore the whole material world is more or less in the mode of passion. Modern civilization is considered to be advanced in the standard of the mode of passion. Formerly the advanced condition was considered to be in the mode of goodness. If there is no liberation for those in the mode of goodness what to speak of those who are entangled in the mode of passion? Bg 14.7 O son of Bharata know that the mode of darkness born of ignorance is the delusion of all embodied living entities. The results of this mode are madness indolence and sleep which bind the conditioned soul. PURPORT In this verse the specific application of the word tu is very significant. This means that the mode of ignorance is a very peculiar qualification of the embodied soul. The mode of ignorance is just the opposite of the mode of goodness. In the mode of goodness by development of knowledge one can understand what is what but the mode of ignorance is just the opposite. Everyone under the spell of the mode of ignorance becomes mad and a madman cannot understand what is what. Instead of making advancement one becomes degraded. The definition of the mode of ignorance is stated in the Vedic literature. Vastu-yathatmya-jnanavarakam viparyaya-jnana-janakam tamah: under the spell of ignorance one cannot understand a thing as it is. For example everyone can see that his grandfather has died and therefore he will also die; man is mortal. The children that he conceives will also die. So death is sure. Still people are madly accumulating money and working very hard all day and night not caring for the eternal spirit. This is madness. In their madness they are very reluctant to make advancement in spiritual understanding. Such people are very lazy. When they are invited to associate for spiritual understanding they are not much interested. They are not even active like the man who is controlled by the mode of passion. Thus another symptom of one embedded in the mode of ignorance is that he sleeps more than is required. Six hours of sleep is sufficient but a man in the mode of ignorance sleeps at least ten or twelve hours a day. Such a man appears to be always dejected and is addicted to intoxicants and sleeping. These are the symptoms of a person conditioned by the mode of ignorance. Bg 14.8Because the three modes are the sum and substance of the material world they are a huge topic. Everyone intuitively has a little idea of them but only a few people have a detailed understanding and I doubt anyone unfamiliar with Vedic knowledge has a good grasp. In chapter 18 there are more verses that deal with a variety of topics under goodness passion and ignorance. I will list just the translations.Bg 18.19 - According to the three different modes of material nature there are three kinds of knowledge action and performer of action. Now hear of them from Me. Bg 18.20 - That knowledge by which one undivided spiritual nature is seen in all living entities though they are divided into innumerable forms you should understand to be in the mode of goodness. Bg 18.21 - That knowledge by which one sees that in every different body there is a different type of living entity you should understand to be in the mode of passion. Bg 18.22 - And that knowledge by which one is attached to one kind of work as the all in all without knowledge of the truth and which is very meager is said to be in the mode of darkness. Bg 18.23 - That action which is regulated and which is performed without attachment without love or hatred and without desire for fruitive results is said to be in the mode of goodness. Bg 18.24 - But action performed with great effort by one seeking to gratify his desires and enacted from a sense of false ego is called action in the mode of passion. Bg 18.25 - That action performed in illusion in disregard of scriptural injunctions and without concern for future bondage or for violence or distress caused to others is said to be in the mode of ignorance. Bg 18.26 - One who performs his duty without association with the modes of material nature without false ego with great determination and enthusiasm and without wavering in success or failure is said to be a worker in the mode of goodness. Bg 18.27 - The worker who is attached to work and the fruits of work desiring to enjoy those fruits and who is greedy always envious impure and moved by joy and sorrow is said to be in the mode of passion. Bg 18.28 - The worker who is always engaged in work against the injunctions of the scripture who is materialistic obstinate cheating and expert in insulting others and who is lazy always morose and procrastinating is said to be a worker in the mode of ignorance18.29 - O winner of wealth now please listen as I tell you in detail of the different kinds of understanding and determination according to the three modes of material nature. Bg 18.30 - O son of Prtha that understanding by which one knows what ought to be done and what ought not to be done what is to be feared and what is not to be feared what is binding and what is liberating is in the mode of goodness. Bg 18.31 - O son of Prtha that understanding which cannot distinguish between religion and irreligion between action that should be done and action that should not be done is in the mode of passion. Bg 18.32 - That understanding which considers irreligion to be religion and religion to be irreligion under the spell of illusion and darkness and strives always in the wrong direction O Partha is in the mode of ignorance. Bg 18.33 - O son of Prtha that determination which is unbreakable which is sustained with steadfastness by yoga practice and which thus controls the activities of the mind life and senses is determination in the mode of goodness. Bg 18.34 - But that determination by which one holds fast to fruitive results in religion economic development and sense gratification is of the nature of passion O Arjuna. Bg 18.35 - And that determination which cannot go beyond dreaming fearfulness lamentation moroseness and illusion-such unintelligent determination O son of Prtha is in the mode of darkness.Bg 18.36 - O best of the Bharatas now please hear from Me about the three kinds of happiness by which the conditioned soul enjoys and by which he sometimes comes to the end of all distress. Bg 18.37 - That which in the beginning may be just like poison but at the end is just like nectar and which awakens one to self-realization is said to be happiness in the mode of goodness. Bg 18.38 - That happiness which is derived from contact of the senses with their objects and which appears like nectar at first but poison at the end is said to be of the nature of passion. Bg 18.39 - And that happiness which is blind to self-realization which is delusion from beginning to end and which arises from sleep laziness and illusion is said to be of the nature of ignorance. Bg 18.40 - There is no being existing either here or among the demigods in the higher planetary systems which is freed from these three modes born of material nature.There are more details in chapter 14 including the circumstances around one’s death because everything material can be understood by the analysis of these three modes.When one dies in the mode of goodness he attains to the pure higher planets of the great sages. Bg 14.15 - When one dies in the mode of passion he takes birth among those engaged in fruitive activities; and when one dies in the mode of ignorance he takes birth in the animal kingdom. From the mode of goodness real knowledge develops; from the mode of passion greed develops; and from the mode of ignorance develop foolishness madness and illusion. Bg 14.17Once a clear picture of the modes of nature has formed a person can navigate through life avoiding the hidden reefs and sandbars that lie invisibly beneath the surface of daily activities.,Murari Das,https://www.quora.com/profile/Murari-Das-1
Was Ayodhya really a Ram temple?,https://www.quora.com/Was-Ayodhya-really-a-Ram-temple,https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b845efc7c0bed8a58661eacd12778a9e,"On August 5 the Bhoomi Pujan of Ram temple took place in Ayodhya. After this land worship many things were done on social media in which the most asked whether there was really a Ram temple in Ayodhya. Ayodhya was ruined after the war of Mahabharata but even during that period the existence of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi was safe and remained intact till about 14th century. According to the facts in 1527-28 on the orders of Babur a mosque was built by demolishing the grand Ram temple built at Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya. A very good anecdote has been found in this subject which is during the hearing of Ram Mandir. Must read this article because no media has told what were the talks during the Ram temple hearing and what facts were presented. Here I am presenting some interesting incidents during the hearing of Ram Mandir. first Incident Judge: - The remains of the walls have been found under the mosque. Lawyer of Muslim side: - Those walls can be of Dargah. Judge :- But your opinion is that the mosque was built on some vacant place not by demolishing any structure. Lawyer of Muslim side :- Silence... Judge :- Some idols have been found in the excavation of SIT. Lawyer of Muslim side: - They can also be children's toys. Judge :- There is also an idol of ""Varaha"" which according to Hindu belief was an incarnation of Lord Vishnu... Was there a practice among Muslims to play with idols..? Lawyer of Muslim side: - Pin Drop silence...!! Second Incident Shri Ram is there in our Vedas as well as his birth place and Ayodhya have also been accurately mentioned. In favor of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Padmavibhushan Jagatguru Rambhadracharya ji (he was blind since the age of two months) was being given evidence from the scriptures in favor of Ram Janmabhoomi. A man sitting in the judge's chair was a Muslim and asked a strange question ""You people ask for proof from Vedas in everything so can you give proof from Vedas that Ram ji was born at the same place in Ayodhya"" On this Ram Bhadra Charya ji said ""I can give sir"" and he started giving examples from the Jaimini Samhita of Rigveda which gave very accurate details of the direction and distance from the particular place of river Sarayu. By order of the court Jaimini Samhita was called and the number mentioned by Rambhadracharya ji was opened and all the mentions were found to be correct. These things became very clear that the disputed place is exactly where the Ram Janmabhoomi should have been and this fact turned the Ram Janmabhoomi decision in favor of the Hindus. The Muslim judge admitted that ""Today I saw the miracle of Indian culture a person who is devoid of material eyes how he was being exemplified by the vast ocean of Vedas and Shastras! If this is not a divine power then what else?

(I am not sure but before dying Abhimanyu succed in killing Dushasan's son also).No kuru warrior intervened inbetween that fight.So why Dushasan's son succeeded. Because without taking a pause Abhimanyu was fighting so he was so tired.You can't compare Dushasan's son with Abhimanyu Abhimanyu was definitely better warrior than Dushasan's son.So ! Death was fair or unfair : You can do a endless debate on it . But you can assume unfair:fair ratio as 6 : 5 but not as much as shown in and described in popular shows and in stories.,Red Hood,https://www.quora.com/profile/Red-Hood-290

Did Yashoda know that Lord Krishna is Lord Vishnu?,https://www.quora.com/Did-Yashoda-know-that-Lord-Krishna-is-Lord-Vishnu,https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-47e340ee272fd51e9c036d1e07002515-lq | https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fd03bba910397af7ea54ed7e02b8929a-lq,Yes she knows that Lord Krishna is God. This knowledge is eternally existent but doesn't manifest. Even if it manifests sometimes it is devoid of any awe and reverence. Mother Yashoda’s love is so intense and sweet that it completely overpowers Aishwarya Jnana (knowledge of the Lord’s glories). This is the act of Yoga-Maya (spiritual potency of the Lord). Mother Yashoda’s love is the pinnacle of devotion. Neither the great sages nor the experts of Vedanta can attain such a pinnacle of devotion. In this regard Srimad Bhagavatam states as followstrayyā copaniṣadbhiś ca sāṅkhya-yogaiś ca sātvataiḥupagīyamāna-māhātmyaṁ hariṁ sāmanyatātmajam ‘’The glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are studied through the three Vedas the Upaniṣads the literature of Sāṅkhya-yoga and other Vaiṣṇava literature yet mother Yaśodā considered that Supreme Person her ordinary child.’’- Srimad Bhagavatam 10.8.45 nemaṁ viriñco na bhavo na śrīr apy aṅga-saṁśrayāprasādaṁ lebhire gopī yat tat prāpa vimuktidāt ‘’Neither Lord Brahmā nor Lord Śiva nor even the goddess of fortune who is always the better half of the Supreme Lord can obtain from the Supreme Personality of Godhead the deliverer from this material world such mercy as received by mother Yaśodā.’’- Srimad Bhagavatam 10.9.20One may ask how such great fortune was received by Mother Yashoda. It is thus explained as followsnāyaṁ sukhāpo bhagavān dehināṁ gopikā-sutaḥjñānināṁ cātma-bhūtānāṁ yathā bhaktimatām iha ‘’The Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa the son of mother Yaśodā is accessible to devotees engaged in spontaneous loving service but He is not as easily accessible to mental speculators (jnanis) to those striving for self-realization by severe austerities and penances (yogis) or to those who consider the body the same as the self (materialists).’’- Srimad Bhagavatam 10.9.21This basically establishes that Lord Krishna can only be attained by Pure Bhakti. Again only the Bhakti devoid of Aishwarya jnana (glories of Lord’s divinity) can control Krishna. This is the epitome of Premamayi Bhakti which is found among the inhabitants of Vrindavana.

Outside of India you can find Hindus Sikhs and Jains eating diets they never did in India. I have noticed that most Hindus and Sikhs who emigrated from India after the mid 1990s for the most part did not make profound changes in their diet. Indian foods became widely available in the West and even more so after the 2000s. There became little reason to give up their diet of choice. This is in profound contrast to Indians who came to the West in the 1950’s though the 1980s. For them diet changes were necessary to survive. Though people such as my mother never changed her diet and endured a great deal of hardship. Eating Beef however is a debatable issue for Sikhs on the one hand Baba Guru Nanak Dev Ji came from the Bedi family which was Hindu. And he did not advocate violence towards animals. The following Sikh Gurus never encouraged the eating of meat. In fact even today Sikh Guanis and those in the employ of Sikh Temples do not eat meat. A Sikh Gurudwara will never serve meat on it’s premises. The environment of India is as such and religion is inseparably linked to the reduction of suffering and violence. There are voices who wish to establish that eating Beef is permissible for Sikhs and to thus bring emphasis to their separate identity. The idea is not founded in a really genuine intent Baba Guru Nanak Dev Ji spoke of tolerance and inclusion. To emphasise the killing of an Animal which is sacred for most in India is not even approaching tolerance nor inclusion. There are many other things to eat in India and pushing forward a divisive tendency is not productive. However when they do consume meat it cannot be “halal” or “kosher” meat but “jhatka” where the animal has ...,Baba Vickram Aditya Bedi,https://www.quora.com/profile/Baba-Vickram-Aditya-Bedi
Lord Shiva killed Ganesha in anger. So later on did Ganesha forgive his father Lord Shiva?,https://www.quora.com/Lord-Shiva-killed-Ganesha-in-anger-So-later-on-did-Ganesha-forgive-his-father-Lord-Shiva,,I would like you to think for a moment. Is it possible for all pervading Siva to not know that Ganesha was His son too? What for was his anger? If Siva is God does He not know Parvati created Ganesha and asked him to keep the gates? The answers to these questions a kid had asked will give you satisfactory answers. The story is more allegoric. It makes sense if you understand the point being driven. Otherwise it is a stupid story. Ganesha was made out of mail (waste out of skin or turmeric applied to the skin). Either case Ganesha then represents the jiva buddhi (separation from Iswara) and hence does not realize Siva and Sakti are same and stops Him from entering. Why the head was cut off? Head is where thinking happens. To attach a new head means that Ganesha changed his way of thinking after that and realized Siva and Sakti are not separate. Therefore in another story later when Ganesha was asked to go around the globe he did go around his parents and said that’s done. This is a story of a person from being egoistic to devotee or Jnani. Nothing more nothing less. Don’t keep digging into the story to find sense out of it. Most of the stories from Puranas intend to give these kind of messages. Lastly since you asked if Ganesha forgave his father he has a name called “heramba” - one of its meanings being a son who always prefers to stay with his father. Hope this helps.

And why Draupadi is adored by everybody as she seems like a very arrogant woman who cares only about her interests. She never showed any great quality to many other ladies of his time.If I fall into any misery and somebody laugh at my face (just not some old lady or man) i'll slap whatever the gender .Also she insulted Karna so she was given same insulting treatment. Where was there any Adharma in that? What is the good message in this context of Mahabharata?Now to answer: Duryodhana never obeyed his elders not even his father and mother. He tried to murder his cousins multiple times. He insulted wise men and sages. Not satisfied with cheating his cousins out of their kingdom out of a rigged game tried to molest their wife and his sister-in-law sent his cousins to forest made them follow one year of slavery incognito tried to humiliate them in the forest (but was humiliated himself) refused to restore the kingdom to Yudhishthira even after completing the terms of the bet tried to capture and kill the messenger of peace (Krishna) caused the death of all his brothers relations and millions of soldiers. And you want to call him ""not bad""? Something seriously wrong with you friend. In the Kali Yuga there are lot of Duryodhana sympathizers. Well this is Kali Yuga; so this is expected. But everyone has the right to question ""why?"". Let us first inspect Duryodhana's claim to the throne. Rewind years (ages) ago. Emperor Bharata ruled India of those times. Indeed India is called Bharatavarsha after Bharata. At the time of his death Bharata appointed his foster son as his worthy successor bypassing his biological and elder sons. He claimed that they did not have the qualities of the king. So the throne of Hastinapur was not automatically the right of the eldest prince. Fast forward a little. Five generations ago before Kauravas and Pandavas Hastinapur was ruled by King Prateepa. Prateepa had three sons - Devapi the eldest Balhika the second and Shantanu the third and youngest. Devapi contacted leprosy. He declared himself unfit to rule and retired to the forest. Balhika went north and somewhere in modern Tajikistan area formed his own kingdom called Balhikas; he renounced his right to Hastinapur. So Shantanu the grandfather of Dhritarashtra became the king. Hastinapur had a set tradition - only a physically sound prince can become the king. Fast forward a little more. Dhritarashtra and Pandu are of age. Bhishma wants to crown Dhritarashtra the king but Vidura their step brother the incarnation of Dharma himself and the wisest man on Earth objected saying a blind person cannot even protect himself and hence unfit to become a protector of the kingdom. The throne went to Pandu. So Dhritarashtra lost the right to the throne. (Inconsistent readers who have not read the mythology properly or failed to understand this fail to see these points. They just think that the eldest prince has an automatic right to the throne). Pandu's renunciation After Pandu was cursed he renounced the throne and went to the forest. Dhritarashtra became a king in proxy. Later on Yudhishthira was born to Pandu and Kunti. A year later Duryodhana was born to Dhritarashtra. By the grace and boon of Sage Vyasa 99 more princes and 1 princess was born to Gandhari and Dhritarashtra (all a month apart). They were known as Kauravas. Pandu showed no intention of returning. He sired four more children. They were called Pandavas. Sixteen years after the birth of Yudhishthira Pandu died as per the curse of Sage Kindama. The fatherless Pandavas returned to Hastinapur with their mother Kunti. All this time Duryodhana was led to believe that his father was the king and he was the heir apparent. All this changed. Now a tussle began. Duryodhana saw that his cousins were more accomplished and Yudhishthira was clearly the favoured one by the other elders. This started the jealousy which turned into intense hatred. He tried to murder his cousin Bhima by poisoning. Granted that Bhima sometimes bullied his cousins but attempting to murder is definitely evil. Not to be outdone Duryodhana made a second attempt burn his cousins and their old mother alive in a specially constructed House of Lac. Pure evil personified. But Pandavas survived all attempts to murder and then they married Draupadi. Now with the alliance of Panchalas and the Yadavas they had become very powerful. Dhritarashtra was forced to invite them back to Hastinapur. Reluctantly he partitioned the kingdom into two halves and gave one of the halves (the barren/arid part) to Pandavas. Yudhishthira accepted this humbly and with their efforts Pandavas built a much better kingdom. Now if Duryodhana's claim to throne was still valid in some minds after the partition all his claim was forfeited. He was now the heir apparent to Hastinapur and no right to Indraprastha. Hence all Duryodhana's deeds from that point on the deceitful game of dice the molestation of Draupadi the second deceitful game of dice banishing of Pandavas to forest etc. were all BAD ACTS nay HORRIBLY EVIL ACTS. Duryodhana's evil acts did not end there.Duryodhana and Karna Duryodhana did not favour Karna because of his lower status. First the ""suta"" is not a low caste like some ""tangewala"". Secondly Duryodhana never showed any favour to other lower born like Vidura Yuyutsu Pratikami his slaves etc. He showed favour to Karna for one reason only - at last he saw that there was someone who was equal to Arjuna. He considered himself equal to Bhima and now that he had Karna he felt that his 99 brothers can easily overcome the other 3 Pandavas. All this idea of friendship and consideration for lower born etc. is a hogwash. Duryodhana showered gifts only on those who were his ""yes-men"" and Karna was the foremost amongst his ""yes-men"". Later on perhaps he did feel a great respect admiration and love for Karna but again because Karna would advise Duryodhana on what he wanted to hear.Draupadi Draupadi did not laugh at Duryodhana in Maya Sabha. She did not taunt him with the words ""blind man's son is also blind"". This is a complete myth and not supported by any authentic book on Mahabharata. When Duryodhana fell into the magical pond of water that looked like firm marble floor Draupadi was not present and not even a witness. She was deep inside the women's chamber. As far as Draupadi insulting Karna in swayamvar there are two thoughts. The BORI CE says that Karna tried to string the bow and shoot the target but failed. KMG's version and a few others say that Draupadi said that she will not marry someone who is a Suta. The Suta caste is considered a lower caste than Kshatriya. As per the ancient Vedic customs a marriage between higher caste woman and lower caste man was considered was called ""Pratiloma"" and not generally sanctioned but sometimes took place. A ""Suta"" is a son of a pratiloma marriage between Kshatriya man and Brahmin woman. So in the first case Draupadi was justified in saying so - if she did say so. Now even if we agree that Draupadi refused Karna because of his caste does this really justify Karna's insult? Indeed then you are justifying the jilted males who throw acid over the girl because she rejected him. Is the OP seriously considering that ""Karna calling Draupadi a prostitute a slave who should be disrobed in front of men"" is not adharma? Gimme a break please. Draupadi was not an arrogant woman. Forget the serials. They tend to hyperventilate. That is the business they are in. Even Shakuni is not the character that he is often shown. Draupadi never insulted anyone. But she was a proud woman. She was born out of fire. When she was insulted dragged to the court (in her condition) molested she demanded revenge. Is that being arrogant? Please put your mother sister or wife in her position and then let me know what she thinks and how she behaves. Message from Mahabharata If you are questioning why Duryodhana is bad then I suggest that you read the Mahabharata again.",Prasanna Bhalerao,https://www.quora.com/profile/Prasanna-Bhalerao

Why are Hindu idols in North Indian temples different from South Indian temples?,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-Hindu-idols-in-North-Indian-temples-different-from-South-Indian-temples,https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-85c5bf48435746bbe572762ff697f174-pjlq,Hindu Idols in temples were created with philosophical meaning religious inspiration and reflect different aspects of the local culture folk and thoughts on divinity. Therefore Idols served as the vehicle or channel for devotees visiting the temple and was not just a mere piece of art. In the Shilpa shastras details such as the length and circumference of fingers length of nails length of nose etc. are dealt with in detail. Guidelines concerning the eyes lips hand positions clothes ornaments are also given. No two images are the same. Body anatomy stances vehicles headgear etc. are all different. Why the difference ? Various materials can be used to make the Idol. The location of the shrine climate and uses are all taken into consideration when deciding the material. The details mentioned in scriptures also taken into account.Difference based on material : In the ancient Vedic text Bhavisyapurana seven main types of materials from which Idols can be used are mentioned: stone metals such as gold silver and copper; wood earth or clay sand paint and gems.Clay Idols : In ancient India clay Idols had been popular especially so in north India. This is explained by the easily available clays and muds deposited by the north's many rivers. In addition clay is easily worked upon by even the lesser talented of Idol makers.Wooden Idols :Wooden Idols are carved. However due to their fragile nature they are not very popular. The Jagannath mandir in Jagannathpuri to this day replaces its wooden images of Krishna Balarama and Subhadra every 12 or 19 years.Bronze Idols :From the late 9th century to the late 13th century the Chola dynasty ruled much of south India. Chola art is best-known for its temple bronze sculpture of Hindu gods and goddesses many of which were designed to be carried in local processions during temple festivals.Marble Idols : Most of the temples in North India have lot of carved marble idols including Buddhist and Jain temples. The marble derived from limestone were available in great quantity in Rajasthan. The ability of marble allowing light to pass diffusely gives a realistic appearance to the idols. Also marbles are weather resistant.In Southern India the material used predominantly for idols is black stone while material in North India is white marble due to the availability of the material. Difference based on appearance : The gods and goddess were seen in two forms :Raudra or Ugra - are images that were meant to terrify induce fear. These typically have wide circular eyes carry weapons have skulls and bones as adornment. These idols were worshipped by soldiers before going to war or by people in times of distress or errors. North India have many temples of deties like Shiva Durga Kali.Shanta and Saumya - are images that were pacific peaceful and expressive of love compassion kindness and other virtues in Hindu pantheon. These images would carry symbolic icons of peace knowledge music wealth flowers. South India temple gods like Guruvayoor krishna Tirupati Balaji.Certainly not all idols depict the same god nor does it depict every god in the same way. In fact the same deity can have more than one murti that reflects different aspects features and roles of it. For example the god Shiva is depicted in his daksinamurti form as a teacher in South India; but in North India he is standing as Pasupati protecting animals and humans. The different forms depict the religious beliefs and cultural history of the place. Despite the differences the idols served as a focus for worship a portal for the experience of god. The different forms looks of the idols helped the devotee to achieve a personal experience of their god.,Venkat,https://www.quora.com/profile/%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%9F-Venkat

Even when the idols have been burnt the “brahma” that makes the neem tree wood idols a living deity has always been saved by one means or the other.Invasion by “Raktabahu” (800 A.D.)The “Madalapanji” records this invasion by the Rashtrakuta empire king Govinda III alias Raktabahu as the first invasion of the Puri temple. He defeated the then king of Odisha Subhanadeva after reaching Puri through the sea route. In this meantime the King had fled Puri along with his associates and carrying the idols to his western frontier to Gopali village near current-day Sonepur of Odisha. He buried the idols there until it was revived 146 years later by Yayati I performed Nabakalebara and brought the Lord back to his home. The place where the three idols were buried is now referred to as “Patali Srikhetra” which is in the current-day Subarnapur district of Odisha. 2. Invasion by Illias Shahi (1340 A.D.) Illias Shahi was the sultan of Bengal who took advantage of the weak northern defense of the then king Narasimhadeva III and attacked Puri. Illias Shahi bribed the commanders at the Raibania fort and was successful in reaching Puri. The King couldn’t defend his people or the temple's wealth but had the idol hidden away at a secret location. The invader killed the people of Puri mercilessly and plundered all the temple wealth that they could. 3. Invasion by Feroz Shah Tughlaq (1360 A.D.) Feroz Shah Tughlaq attacked Puri when it was under the rule of the Ganga dynasty King Bhanudeva III. The king was not in Puri when the attack happened but when he reached with his army he found that Tughlaq had already left for Delhi. Nothing is known about his desecration or plunder of the temple. However some scholars believe that the idols were supposedly thrown in the sea by the invader but there’s no evidence to support this in history. 4. Invasion by Ismail Ghazi (1509 A.D.) Ismail Ghazi was the commander of the then Sultan of Bengal Allaudin Hussain Shah. Puri was then under the protection of King Prataprudradeva who was in the south at the time of the invasion. The priests of the temple sailed the three idols to an island in Chilika lake called “Chadeiguha pahada” (Bird-poop mountain) for their safekeeping. On getting the news of the invasion the King rushed back to protect Utkala and was successful in driving out the invaders to the point of Hooghly in Bengal. 5. Invasion by Kalapahada (1568 A.D.) Perhaps the most dreaded and the most discussed invasion on the Jagannath temple has to be this one by Kalapahada. The local folklore is full of dreaded stories of this man who had taken upon him to destroy all idols that the Hindus worshipped. King Mukundadeva was the ruler of Puri when Kalapahada one of the assistant army generals of the Afghan Sultan of Bengal Sulaiman Karrani. This expedition was commanded by Karrani’s son Bayazid and was assisted by Sikander Uzbeg and Kalapahada. The reason why Karrani decided to attack the kingdom was twofold. First Mukundadeva had given political asylum to Ibrahim Sur an enemy of the Sultan of Bengal. Second in 1566 A.D. when Mughal emperor Akbar had sent envoys to the court of Mukundadeva he reciprocated by sending a Hindu ambassador back to his court. These actions had created enough bad blood in the mind of the Afghani sultan against King Mukundadeva. When Kalaphada attacked King Mukundadeva sent Raghubhanja Chottray to resist the Bengal army but failed. Raghubhanja proved traitor and allowed Kalapahada to occupy Cuttack. King Mukundadeva had no choice but to surrender before the Bengal army. In the meantime Ramachandra Bhanja the commander of the Sarangagarh fort (Baranga) had rebelled against Mukundadeva declared himself the king of Odisha. Faced with no choice Mukundadeva entered into a treaty with Sulaiman and marched against Ramachandra Bhanja. Unfortunately that was the battle where he was killed by the latter and that marked the end of the last Hindu king of Odisha. Soon after on that very day Ramachandra Bhanja was killed by Bayazid the fort of Sarangagarh had now fallen. After the capture of forts at Cuttack and Sarangagarh Kalapahada led his army to desecrate the temple of Jagannath at Puri. In this meantime the servitors of Puri on hearing the fall of Cuttack to the Muslims had taken the idol away and were hidden underground at Hastipatna in Parikuda certain symbols had been used by the priests so that they could identify that hidden location. Unfortunately Kalahpahada could identify them and got the deities out. He carried them on elephant back to the banks of Ganga where he burnt them. The burning was in progress when he felt a splitting body pain his son pushed the half-burnt idols into the flowing river. A little downstream a Vaishnavite saint Bisher Mohanty who by some account had followed Kalapahada on his way back collected the “brahma” from the idols put it inside a mridanga and consecrated it at a temple in Gadakujanga of present-day Jagatsinghpur in Odisha. From 1568 to 1575 A.D. the brahma lived in that temple. In 1575 A.D. it was Ramachandra Deva who got the brahma from there and kept it at Khordha fort for a year. In 1576 A.D. after a Nabakalebara the deities were finally consecrated in the temple at Puri. 6. Invasion by Suleman and Osha (1592 A.D.) After the fall of the Gajapati kingdom in 1568 A.D. Suleiman Karrani had appointed Qutlu Khan Lohani as governor of Puri respectively. Qutlu Khan’s son — Suleman aided by another general of the Bengal sultan Isa Khan’s son Osha jointly attacked the temple at Puri. They plundered the temple wealth desecrated images at the temple and also killed innocent civilians mercilessly. This was the time when Ramachandradeva the Bhoi dynasty ruler had established the kingdom at Khurda. Though he didn’t face the invaders these invaders violated a treaty that was signed between Isa Khan and Raja Mansingh the Mughal general in 1590 A.D. The Mughal general finally suppressed the militant activities of these two invaders. 7. Invasion by Mirza Khurram (1601 A.D.) Mirza Khurram was the commander of the Nawab of Bengal who attacked Puri during the Dola festival (the one celebrated a day before Holi). The servitors got a whiff of it and shifted the idols by boat through river Bhargavi to Kapileswarpur village near Puri. When Mirza Khurram did arrive at the temple he couldn’t find the idols and just took away all the underground treasury. The deities lived at the Panchamukhi Gosani temple at Kapileswarpur celebrated the Dola festival there and thereafter were shifted to Dobandha Pentha where they stayed for 8 months with only “Shital Bhoga” offerings. 8. Invasion by Hasim Khan (1608 A.D.) Hasim Khan was the subedar of Odisha when he attacked the temple in 1608 A.D. This was the time when Purushottam Deva was the King of Khurda he got the deities to the Gopal temple at his capital even before Hasim reached Puri. Though he couldn’t find the deity just to satisfy his master then Mughal emperor Jahangir plundered the temple wealth and just left. King Purushottam Deva returned the idols back to the temple in 1608 A.D. 9. Invasion by Kesodamaru (1610 A.D.) Kesodamaru was a Hindu Rajput who served under Hasim Khan. He arrived in Puri during the rath yatra disguised as a pilgrim along with his faithful soldiers who were without military uniform. They entered the temple during the time when the deities were at the Gundicha temple. They converted it into a fort and looted crores worth of treasury of the temple. Unfortunately at that time King Purushottamdeva was not available at Puri. Upon hearing the news he rushed in with all his military might. His famous paikas (soldiers) jumped into the temple climbing on the chariots and fought against the Rajput invaders within the temple premises. Kesodamaru ordered his soldiers to burn the chariots that the paikas were using to enter the temple premises they did and killed a lot many paikas that way. The King accepted defeat and let the invaders escape. The deities remained at the Gundicha temple for 8 months before being brought back on Vimanas to the temple. 10. Invasion by Kalyan Mal (1611 A.D.) Kalyan Mal was the son of Raja Todar Mal one of the navaratnas in the Mughal court of Akbar. He ruled over Orissa as subedar from 1611 to 1617 A.D. after Hasim Khan. Like Kesodamaru he wanted to satisfy Jahangir by plundering the temple at Puri. He marched against the King of Khurda and captured many of his territories. King Purushottamdeva had no choice but to surrender before him. He even signed a treaty of peace and paid 3 lakhs rupees tribute to the royal exchequer gave up his best elephant Seshnag for use by the emperor. Even before the battle the servitors had moved the image to Mahisanasi in Chilika lake which is now called Brahmapura or Chakanasi. The idols remained there for a year before being brought back to the temple at Puri. The invader could only take the temple treasures. 11. Invasion by Kalyan Mal (1612 A.D.) Kalyan Mal had tried to attack the temple at Puri twice. In the first attack he not only looted the treasure but also treacherously murdered a minister of the king and sixteen skilled generals. When he attacked the second time the King was not present in Puri. However his brave paikas took up the cause to save the state. They were successful in pushing the invaders beyond the northern border of Cuttack killing many of his soldiers. The vigilant servitors took the deities on a fleet of boat from Mahisanasi to “Lotani Baragaccha” (banyan tree) and then after that they were placed at the Dadhibamana temple. That was the last time Kalyan Mal ever attacked the kingdom till his end of tenure in 1671 A.D. 12. Invasion by Mukarram Khan (1617 A.D.) In 1617 A.D. Mughal emperor Jahangir appointed Mukarram Khan as the governor of Odisha. Right from the start Mukarram Khan created a reign of terror and was very open about his display of hatred for idol worship. In a panic the temple priests carried the idols away to Gobapadar near Puri where they were placed at the Bankanidhi temple. Owing to the reign of terror that Mukarram Khan had created the then king Raja Purushottam Deva revolted. Mukarram Khan invaded Khurdha and since the King couldn’t stop it from happening he fled to Rajmundhry. The kingdom of Khurdha was annexed to the Mughals for a short time. Mukarram Khan failed to locate the deities and fled with the riches and gold but was drowned in water on the way back. Raja Purushottam Deva returned and instilled himself as the king of Khurda once again. It was only in 1620 A.D. that the deities returned again to Puri. 13. Invasion by Mirza Ahmad Beg (1621 A.D.) Mirza Ahmed Beg was the nephew of Mughal empress Noorjahan. Ahmed Beg became the governor of Odisha in 1621 A.D. He invaded Khurdha at a time when Purushottam Deva was trying to strengthen his position with the help of the chiefs of Banapur Ranapur and Karnata. It was at Karnata where he finally died and was to be succeeded by his son Narasingha Deva when Ahmed Beg intervened. Mirza Ahmed Beg put forward two conditions — the new emperor should accept Mughal sovereignty and that the governor’s family would be lodged at Cuttack. Narasimha Deva rejected both the terms. Out of anger Ahmed Beg attacked Khurda. The new king Narasingha Deva was successful in resisting the attack. However during this time the rebellious Mughal prince Shah Jahan arrived in Odisha with his army. Out of fear of being attacked Ahmed Beg fled to Bengal. Shah Jahan continued his march from Cuttack to Allahabad and Oudh across Odisha. This march of the Mughals prompted the priests to carry the idols to Andharigada at the mouth of river Shalia across the Chilika lake. Efforts were made the transfer the brahma to Gadamanitri in Khurda district. The trio was finally brought back to Puri in 1624 A.D. and the mahaprasad bhoga was re-introduced. 14. Invasion by Amir Mutaquad Khan (1645 A.D.) Also known as Mirza Makki he became the governor of Odisha in 1651 A.D. During his governorship the then King Narasimha Deva was treacherously killed by his nephew Gangadhar who occupied the throne. During the invasion he not only plundered the temple but also the old palace at Balisahi. The details about what happened to the idols or where they were hidden are not known. 15. Invasion by Amir Fateh Khan (1647 A.D.) Amir Fateh Khan attacked the temple and plundered all its wealth in gold gems stones pearls etc. The details about what happened to the idols or where they were hidden are not known. 16. Invasion by order of Aurangzeb (1692 A.D.) Emperor Aurangzeb issued an order in 1692 A.D. to destroy the temple of Jagannath in Puri. At the time the kingdom of Khurda was being ruled by Dibyasingha Deva. Following Aurangzeb’s order then Nawab of Odisha Ekram Khan along with his brother Mastram Khan attacked the temple. Unable to face the invader the king hid away in an unknown place. The deities were hidden behind the Bimala temple within the precincts of Srimandira. The Nawab attacked and ransacked the temple and even climbed up to the Ratna singhasana of Lord Jagannath. The idols were then shifted one after another to Maa Bhagabati temple at Gadakokal in Brahmagiri block (the Madalapanji states that it was only the Bije-Pratima and not the actual idols). The deities were then moved from Gadakokal to Banpur across the Chilika lake. It was only in 1699 A.D. that the Lord finally returned to the temple at Puri. 17. Invasion by Muhammad Taqi Khan (1731 A.D. and 1733 A.D.) Taqi Khan invaded the temple twice and with an iconoclastic zeal. He invaded to demolish the temple desecrate the idols plundered all he could. He was successful in everything except ever getting his hands on the trio. The priests moved the idols to Hariswar in Banapur then to Chikili in Khallikote then Rumagarh in Kodala then Athagada in Ganjam and then finally to Marda of Kodala. Kodala located in Athagada region was a safe place because it was under the rule of the Nizam of Hyderabad and not the Mughals. The ruler of Athagada Jagannath Harichandan Jagdev had strong relations with the Gajapati rulers of Khurda. The idols were kept at Marda from 29th December 1733 till 31st December 1736. A beautiful temple was hastily constructed at Marda and all rituals and festivals were religiously followed. It is even believed that the rath yatra was organized during this time as well. Marda is hence considered as Jagannath’s second home. After the Lord moved to Puri the temple remained vacant for centuries. Every Ekadasi day an earthen lamp is lit and slokas in honor of the King who made a second home for the Lord is recited. Around 1752 A.D. when the Maratha influence was high the then King Birakishore Deva was afraid of a Maratha invasion of the Jagannath temple. To allay his fears Maratha Dewan Bahadur Khan wrote a letter to the King assuring that no invasion would happen on the temple under the Maratha rule the worship of the Lord should continue without any more fear. 18. Invasion by followers of Mahima Dharma (1881 A.D.) The followers of Mahima Dharma don’t believe in idol worship and shunned the worship of Jagannath. So in the year of 1881 a large number of followers of Mahima dharma gathered in Puri from Sambalpur and Raipur and as per records got the three idols out onto the Grand Trunk Road and set them on fire. This was an incident that could have been avoided. But anyway an FIR was lodged and all the invaders were put behind the bars. The most significant feature in the history of invasion on the great temple of Lord Jagannath at Puri that in no case the ‘Brahma’ of the deities were destroyed which continued till today. The servitors played an important role in safeguarding the triad at the time of danger. The Kings havetaken care of the temple from destruction by surrendering before the invaders. In Ayodhya Kasi and Mathura the mosques have been built in place of the temples due to Muslim invasion. At Puri the temple of Lord Jagannath has always remained standing despite all invasions. No mosque had been erected which is the miracle of the deities. The people of Puri have suffered but kept the temple safe.,Jagannath Khuntia,https://www.quora.com/profile/Jagannath-Khuntia-8
What is the Mookambika Temple famous for?,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-Mookambika-Temple-famous-for,,The Kolluru Mookambika Temple was named after “Kola Maharishi” who did penance to the Hindu Trinity of Brahma Vishnu and Shiva and there is a “Swayambhu” or Self manifested Lingam of Lord Shiva which has a golden line cutting it into half in which the left half represents Tridevis and the right half represents Trimurtis. Along with this a four-handed panchaloha idol of Goddess Mookambika is also installed. It is believed that Adi Shankaracharya had a vision of Sri Mookambika Devi and installed the deity here. One day Devi appeared before Adi Shankaracharya asking for his wish. He revealed his wish to install the Devi idol in a place in Kerala to worship. Devi agreed but put forward a condition that she will follow Shankara and he should not look back till he reaches his destination. But to test Shankara Devi deliberately stopped the noise of her anklets when they reached Kollur whereupon Shankara turned and looked back because of doubt. Devi then asked Shankara to install her vigraha at that very location at Kollur. The original temple where Shankara meditated and Devi appeared before him is at Kodachadri peak (1343 mt) which is at a distance of about 21 kms from Kollur also visible as a large mountain peak from Kollur Shri Mookambika Devi Temple.

Hence Vishnu temples must have only one deity as the main deity under that roof and not even any other avataara of Vishnu too.The person ‘S Dev Pandey’ was a fanatic. So there is no need to take most of his words seriously. He blasphemed nearly every single Vaishnava Aachaarya and sampradaaya. According to him:Shripaada Ramanujacharya was equivalent to Prajaapati Daksha for saying that Vishnu is greater than Shiva.ISKCON has insulted Shiva by calling him a demigod.But it is 100% correct to say that Shiva is greater than Vishnu and everyone must accept this.Vaishnavas want to insult Shiva by calling the Shaiva Puraanas taamasic.But he either is unaware of or intentionally ignores the fact that Shaivas consider the Vaishnava Puraanas to be taamasic.There are many more such wrongdoings of this guy but I won’t go into the details of those. The important fact is: such fanatics need not be taken seriously. Thanks for reading.Harihi Om.,Praajna (aka Venkatanaatha Suta),https://www.quora.com/profile/Praajna-aka-Venkatanaatha-Suta

It maybe minimalistic art-pop retro or traditional style it should be representing YOU. •give proper SCALING to each object - Its important to scale your objects and texts the things that you want viewers to see firstly you should scale it big and light in color(because you don't want to distract the viewer also) The things that are less important can be subtle and small. Another important thing is description of the project always scale the texts as readable and put minimum required words. •design COVER PAGE that represent YOU - the most important page of your portfolio is the cover page and the first thing that a viewer will notice so you must design the cover page that will show your taste or style in design it may show your best sketches your best photograph your best drafted drawing any abstract illustration or other. •don't forget the BACK COVER - Always present a glimpse of your style on the back cover (small in scale) and put your contact information so that after having a brief look into your portfolio the viewer will see your contact details and would be willing to contact you.

The Son fell dead on being administered poison.SB 6.16.14 bāla-ghnyo vrīḍitās tatra  bāla-hatyā-hata-prabhāḥ bāla-hatyā-vrataṁ cerur  brāhmaṇair yan nirūpitam yamunāyāṁ mahārāja  smarantyo dvija-bhāṣitam  Translation:  Queen Kṛtyadyuti’s co-wives who had poisoned the child were very much ashamed and they lost all their bodily luster. While lamenting O King they remembered the instructions of Aṅgirā and gave up their ambition to bear children. Following the directions of the brāhmaṇas they went to the bank of the Yamunā where they bathed and atoned for their sinful activities.  Purport:  In this verse the word bāla-hatyā-hata-prabhāḥ is to be particularly noted. The practice of killing children has existed in human society for a long time — since time immemorial — but in the days of yore it was very rarely performed. At the present moment however in this Age of Kali abortion — killing of the child within the womb — has become very common and sometimes a child is even killed after birth. If a woman performs such an abominable act she gradually loses all her bodily luster (bāla-hatyā-hata-prabhāḥ). It is also to be noted that the ladies who had committed the sinful act of administering poison to the child were very much ashamed and according to the directions of the brāhmaṇas they had to undergo atonement for killing the child. Any woman who has ever performed such an infamously sinful act must atone for it but no one now is doing that. Under the circumstances the women responsible must suffer in this life and the next. Those who are sincere souls after hearing this incident should refrain from such child-killing and should atone for their sinful activities by taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness very seriously. If one chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra without offenses all of one’s sinful actions are surely atoned for immediately but one should not commit such deeds again for that is an offense.,Ganapati Govind Das,https://www.quora.com/profile/Ganapati-Govind-Das

Anyways I better not be judgemental and here is your answer- the so called 16000 (or 16100) women were in captivity of a demon namely- Narkasur. Krishna killed Narkasur and released 16100 women that Narakasura had in captivity. When krishna asked them to return to their houses they refused. They were aware that the society of that age would not take back those who were taken by another man. So they were left with nowhere to go. When Krishna asked them what they wanted to do they all wanted Krishna to marry them. Krishna married them all at the same auspicious time assuming that many bodies so they could gain status of married women and live in the society with honor again. Krishna constructed them each a palace with huge gardens ful of colorful flowers It was impossible to live with each of them so he created 16100 forms of himself so that he could treat them all in the same manner as his 8 wives. Scriptures say that each of them had 10 sons and 1 daughter. Note 1: Some stories say that each of 16100 women were rishis from the past who wanted to be part of Lord's incarnation on earth. Who wanted to live closer to him and witness his life. Upon their prayer to lord vishnu he granted them the boon to be his wives in his next incarnation on earth. Note 2: Some stories say 16100 women were Gopis who did not want to marry any one else but krishna who thus remained unmarried throughout their lives. Note 3: Another theory relates the Krishna who plays the flute and the lover of music and his 16000 wives to the 16000 ragas or musical modes or passions or affections of the mind in Indian classical music and their wives - the raginis (female raga). The raginis selected one of these ragas to which to modulate her strains for affecting and securing the heart of Krishna the amorous and harmonious deity. Krishna who was devoted to music received and enjoyed every variety of modulation multiplied to the number of 16000 fancifully personified in the form of the women derived from Bhauma (a name of Narakasura) a five-stringed musical instrument Last but not least- Lord Krishna is the Supreme Lord himself with all 16 characters of Lord Vishnu. He wasn’t a prophet…. So any question on Lord Krishna should better be no- nonsense.,Satendra Singh,https://www.quora.com/profile/Satendra-Singh-71

Once there was an old saint who with his meditative powers and yogic karma seeked Lord Shiva’s holy manifestation before him. Lord Shiva thus appeared before the saint and asked him his wish. The conversation went something like this: Saint: “Oh Mahadeva ! I wish to know who is your Father.” To which lord Shiva Replied. “Brahma is my Father!” This may seem obvious as Brahma is known to be the father of all creation.Next the saint followed “Who is your Grandfather?” To which lord Shiva Replied “Vishnu is my Grandfather!” Another story known (perhaps explanation for another time) is that lord Brahma appeared through the lotus bud that sprouted from lord Vishnu’s navel.Now the saint asked “Then who is your Great Grandfather?” And to the astonishment of the saint Lord Shiva replied “I am my Great Grandfather!” This story  like any other Sanatana dharma’s mythology and Vedic teachings is philosophical and symbolic in meaning. It speaks about the circle of life and that the nature or the decisive structure of creation and destruction which is symbolic in characterisation. Lord Shiva is know as Anaadi the starting point of everything. So his realm divinity and philosophy comes in full circles.He is the one with no beginning and the one with no end.,Mahesh Mesta,https://www.quora.com/profile/Mahesh-Mesta-5
Is Hinduism an unclear religion?,https://www.quora.com/Is-Hinduism-an-unclear-religion,,All religions are unclear until one enters deeper into their original messages and meanings and until one stands on personal spiritual experiential knowledge out of superstitious and non-superficial realms of religions. However we could say that among the religions Hinduism is “more-unclear” because of its colorful multi-faceted spiritually unusually rich tradition. For individuals who are spiritually matured (in whatever of spiritual traditions) there is no unclear religion (better to say their deeper contexts).,Stefan Pecho,https://www.quora.com/profile/Stefan-Pecho

Perhaps the answer is hidden in the last Answer of a very famous and arguably respectful entity : NATHURAM GODSE the murderer of Gandhi I’ll just try to translate his last words in the court at the time of trial of Gandhi’s Murder case. “I had conflicts with leaders and I still carry them. This is comprehensible from my letter named Savarkar dated 28 Feb 1935. I have the same ideology even today. I did not have any hostility with Gandhi Ji. People say that his heart was pure in Pakistan’s plan. I want to convey to people that I do not have anything other than patriotism. I had to use the arms because at the time of partition the cruel and frightful things that took place were solely led by Gandhi Ji. I knew that after the murder people will change their views about me I’ll loose all the respect I have in the society.I knew that I’ll be criticized brutally by the newspapers but I didn’t know that Newspapers would degenerate to such a level that they’ll start killing the truth. Newspapers never wrote impartially. If they cared about the Nation and paid less attention to the personal wishes of certain people then the national leaders would have never accepted Pakistan. Newspapers clearly followed the ideology of hiding the brutal and unworthy mistakes of leaders. This made our country’s division easy. I feared such corrupt newspapers but I made sure that I don’t bend in front of them.Some say that if Pakistan wasn’t formed we couldn't have got independence I don’t consider this right. This is a made up excuse by the leaders in an attempt to hide their sins. Gandhivadi(followers of Gandhi) say that they got Swaraj by their own will. If they got Swaraj by their own will how did the British were even able to state conditions of Division? Why didn’t they use their will to oppose them?According to me Mahatma and his followers always had one policy that is showing opposition toward the demands of British then try and compensate and then totally agree on their terms. This is how Pakistan’s formation was accepted.On 15 August 1947 Pakistan was accepted Trick fully. No thought was given to the Hindus of Punjab Bengal and other states across the border. Country was broken into pieces and a Nation was formed just on the basis of religion. Muslims got the fruit of their anti national seeds in the form of Pakistan. Gandhivadis called those people anti-nationals and communal who were against Pakistan and themselves accepted Pakistan and agreed to all the conditions of Jinnah.This destroyed my mental peace. After the creation of Pakistan if congress government did something for the protection of Hindus in Pakistan then my Anger would have decreased. I couldn't see the betrayal of my own people. Crores of Hindus were left on the mercy of Muslims and promoted the idea that Hindus should not come to India and should remain in Pakistan. This way Hindus were trapped in the clutter of Muslims and became prey to the calamities there. Thousands of Hindus were killed everyday 15 Lakh sikhs were brutally murdered on the gunpoint. Hindu Women were taken out for processions nude. They were sold just as Animals. Lakhs of Hindus had to save their Religion and run. If Indian Government pressurized Pakistan Government or warned them of a similar treatment to Muslims in India then I believe this situation would not have come. But they did nothing to save the Hindu community there.Indian government ran on the ideals of Gandhi Ji and If a newspaper wrote something about the conditions of Hindus there they were considered as the creators of tensions among the two groups. There things were started to considered as Criminal. Press Emergency Act was established and one after the other truth was uprooted. Even I got certain notice and ₹60000 were demanded. Around 900 such instances took place. When the press association visited Morarji Desai he didn’t cater to a single demand.By this I was clear that non-violence was not the answer to the Gandhivadi Congress Government. Around this time Gandhi gave no statement against Pakistan. Pakistan left no stone upturned to reduce or completely end the Hindu culture.The most important thing is that in reference to the Hindu-Muslim conflict Gandhi never catered to the very demands and viewpoint of general Public. It is clear that until Pakistan remains based on religion and is communal India can never be at peace. ”The speech continues to a lot more and covers a lot of other instances. Certainly the answer would become to long to be readable if I translate every word. Therefore I’ll brief certain more points of his speech.Gandhi sat on Anshan(Hunger Strike) with demands such as getting the Mosques in Delhi free from Hindus. Hindus obviously were residing there out of Helplessness.Gandhi cleverly kept no condition for Pakistan because he knew that Jinnah would have no affect and he certainly would die out of Hunger and the world would see how such a bold man is not able to get a country he gave Independence to agree to a single condition.Gandhi’s bones were flown in many rivers in many parts of the world without a single bone being flown in any river in Pakistan.Godse did not run or did not even try to run because he wanted the world to know why he killed Gandhi.Godse only fired 2 bullets But his body had 4 bullets fired in it.He said I could have poisoned Gandhi or killed him in a way that it looks like a natural death but I chose to kill him with bullets so I can tell the world the truth that would never come out otherwise.Essentially I am not a believer of either of the ideology. I make no declaration to the truthfulness of any of the facts. This simply is the answer to why Gandhi is hated even today by many people in India and outside. I’d also thank Quora for bringing up such a great platform to share different views and opinions. That’s why one certainly loves Quora. I’m certainly happy that today Indian Muslims and Hindus are brothers and sister and the sour feeling no more exist. Please Upvote and follow. It’s the true inspiration for a Writer.

Pashupati Nath means Lord to all animals here Lord to animals means the God to the animal instincts in us too. When we surrender to Him He will relieve us from all the gunas or qualities and dissolves us into Him. The Pashupatinath temple is one of the biggest temples of Shiva located on the banks of the Bagmati Rover in the eastern part of Kathmandu the capital city of Nepal.The temple is listed in UNESCO World Heritage Sites list.There are many temples dedicated to other Gods in the temple complex which include Vaishnav temple Ram temple from the 14 th century and Guhyeshwari temple mentioned in an 11 th century manuscript.It is regarded as the most sacred among the temples of Shiva.Kotirudra Samhita chapter 11 on the Shivlingas of the north in Shiva Purana mention this Shivlinga as the bestower of all wishes.On the important festival of Maha Shivratri the temple is flooded with nearly 1 million devotees.According to Nepal Mahatmaya and Himavatkhanda the diety here gained fame and is dated back to 400 ADThe Shakti Peetha of Mata Sati is located near to the Pashupati Nath temple.Story of Pashupati Nath ::One day Shiva and Parvathi came to Kathmandu Valley and rested by the Bagmati River while on a journey.It is believed that Shiva and Parvathi were impressed by its scenic beauty that they transformed themselves into deers and walked into the forest.Meanwhile All Gods were searching for Shiva and last found Him in deer form and they requested Shiva to return back to Khailash.After much persuading Shiva agreed to return. But since Shiva lived by the bagmati in a deer’s form He would now be known as Pashupathi nath Lord of all animals. And Shiva manifested himself into a Linga there.It is a popular belief that whoever comes here and beheld the lingam here he would never be born as an animal.It is said that the wish fulfilling Cow Kamadhenu took shelter in a cave in the near by Chandravan mountainEvery day Kamadhenu Cow went down to the place where the Lingam was sunken into the soil and poured her milk on the top of the soil.After 10000 years some people who saw this incident were surprised and they removed the soil only to see the Shivlinga. When the people touched the Lingam they disappeared into the Lingam and thus attained liberation.Thus many people started to attain moksha and this was a concern for Lord Brahma the creator.Later after few centuries a temple was constructed for the Linga. In Which year exactly the temple was constructed  still remains a controversy.Reconstruction of the temple was done again in 17 th century by Nepal King.,Sunitha Parapatla,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sunitha-Parapatla

There are some funny answers here one points at a pillar to prove a point another one claims that Vikramaditya ruled Arabia. Social media played a huge role in fueling this rumour. Memes like this are doing rounds :Truth is Kaaba is not a Shiva temple. Before Mohammad started preaching a new religion the Arabians followed Arabian Paganism - a polytheistic faith system. [1] Kaaba was a holy site for Arabian Pagans and it hosted the idols of the pagan deities. The chief deity was Hubal - the moon god.After the invasion of Mecca Mohammad took over Kaaba and destroyed the idols present in the Kaaba. Since then it became a holy site for Muslims.Kaaba and Shivalinga rumour : The credit for linking Shivalinga with Arabs goes to Savarkar. In his book “Six glorious epochs of Indian history “ In paragraph 650 he claims Arabians worshipped Shivalinga. [2]Let’s not blame Savarkar entirely for the rumour. The rumour has a long history. The Islamic rumour about Somnath Lingam : In fact early Muslims thought that the Idol of Somnath Linga was the statue of Arabian pagan goddess. Romilla Thapar wrote : [3] “A major poet of the eastern Islamic world Farrukhi Sistani who claims that he accompanied Mahmud to Somanatha provides a fascinating explanation for the breaking of the idol. This explanation has been largely dismissed by modern historians as too fanciful but it has a significance for the assessment of iconoclasm. According to him the idol was not of a Hindu deity but of a pre-Islamic Arabian goddess. He tells us that the name Somnat (as it was often written in Persian) is actually Su-manat the place of Manat. We know from the Qur'an that Lat Uzza and Manat were the three pre-Islamic goddesses widely worshipped and the destruction of their shrines and images it was said had been ordered by the Prophet Mohammad. Al-lat Manat and Al-Uzza :Two were destroyed but Manat was believed to have been secreted away to Gujarat and installed in a place of worship. According to some descriptions Manat was an aniconic block of black stone so the form could be similar to a lingam. This story hovers over many of the Turko-Persian accounts some taking it seriously others being less emphatic and insisting instead that the icon was of a Hindu deity. THE identification of the Somanatha idol with that of Manat has little historical credibility. There is no evidence to suggest that the temple housed an image of Manat. Nevertheless the story is significant to the reconstruction of the aftermath of the event since it is closely tied to the kind of legitimation which was being projected for Mahmud.”It is interesting to note that early Muslims believed the rumour that Somnath Idol was that of Al-manat’s idol. While today’s far right Hindus believe Kaaba was a Shiva temple which hosted a Linga.Footnotes[1] Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia - Wikipedia[2] https://savarkar.org/en/pdfs/6_Glorious_Epochs_of_Indian_History.pdf[3] txt_thapar_somnath,Ambika Vijay,https://www.quora.com/profile/Ambika-Vijay

So how can this be created. And various scriptures give various references. Once there was a Asura called Durg and the Goddess who killed him was called Durga. More commonly  when the buffalo asura Mahishasura was tormenting the Gods as he had a boon that he could be killed only by a woman; the Goddess created from the energies of all Gods and Goddess was called Durga.,Babu Roy,https://www.quora.com/profile/Babu-Roy

This way she is never separate from Vishnu even when he assumes different avataaras (V.P 1.9.144) When Hari assumes the form of devata Lakshmi becomes his devi when Hari becomes man (human form) she becomes his woman. In this way she too assumes forms according to the forms of bhagavan Vishnu. (V.P 1.9.145)Thus we can understand the eternal relationship between the divine couple Sri Rukmini Krishna. She is personification of his divine attributes. She is his ichha shakti “willing potency”. She is the canvas through which he projects his kalyana gunas. He express his desires through her. For Sristi Sthiti Laya Anugraha and Nigraha they play the game in which she desires and he fulfills. He especially projects some special kalyana gunas like compassion forgiveness and extreme love towards the devotees only through her. Gopala Tapani upanisada says Rukmini is the eternal consort of Krishna who is never separable from him and she is the potency with which he creates operates and destroys the entire creations.,Bhawesh Bhattarai,https://www.quora.com/profile/Bhawesh-Bhattarai
How can we say that God was here before the Big Bang when there was no 'before' the Big Bang?,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-say-that-God-was-here-before-the-Big-Bang-when-there-was-no-before-the-Big-Bang,,Imagine the following: I program a computer. The computer contains a physical simulation of a complex system. Initial conditions of that simulation correspond to a singularity so not only do these initial conditions represent the beginning of the simulation it is mathematically impossible to extend the simulation to a prior moment. In my simulation time really begins at that moment; there is no “before”. Yet here I am existing independently of that simulation. My time (measured by my clock) is not the same as the simulation time (measured by a variable in the simulation program code.) I existed “before” the simulation started even though within the simulation there is no “before”. If my simulation is sufficiently complex maybe even intelligent beings emerge in this simulated reality. Beings who start to wonder about the nature of their own existence. Beings who discover the rules (programmed by me) that govern their simulated universe. Thus they will discover that time (the only time they know) has a definite beginning and that there is no “before”. And perhaps some of these beings become philosophers wondering about the (im)possibility of an eternal god given that they live in a universe that had a finite beginning. Short story: If you believe in a god you need not believe that this god is actually part of this universe in which we live. Perhaps your god exists outside of it not subject to the rules that govern this universe.,Viktor T. Toth,https://www.quora.com/profile/Viktor-T-Toth-1

Everyone must know where the residing place of Kali is. Kali Yuga is said to have started with the descent of the demon Kali. Although it is said that it started just after the return of Sri Krishna to Vaikuntha this Yuga kept its first step on Earth on the ninth day of the Mahabharata War. Due to the presence of Sri Krishna it couldn't spread to the entire world. Parikshit the son of Abhimanyu became the King of Hastinapur after Yudhisthir. Pre-informed about Kali Parikshit decided to stop him who was entering his kingdom along with his weapons of treachery lust greed and evil. The King hunted the demon until the latter surrendered and explained him the rules of Brahma. Kaliyuga began to pray –kalir uvācayatra kva vātha vatsyāmisārva-bhauma tavājñayālakṣaye tatra tatrāpitvām ātteṣu-śarāsanamtan me dharma-bhṛtāṁ śreṣṭhasthānaṁ nirdeṣṭum arhasiyatraiva niyato vatsyaātiṣṭhaṁs te ‘nuśāsanamO Your Majesty though I may live anywhere and everywhere under your order I shall but see you with bow and arrows wherever I look. Therefore O chief amongst the protectors of religion please fix some place for me where I can live permanently under the protection of your government. Parikshit released Kali Yuga warning him to not destroy the mankind before its time to end. He said “You shall only live in these 5 places and never cross your boundary. People who willingly come to these places would become the victims of the demon Kali Yuga.”Places where liquor is served- Weapon of poisonYou must only stay here and welcome those who come willingly and should never force people to surrender to you. 2. Brothels- Weapon of Lust Anyone who enters the premises would have to shed off their dignity sanity and humanity and only then you may devour them. 3. Slaughter house- Weapon of Evil You must reside in this place where humans leave behind their humanity and reveal the evil inside them and butcher innocent animals and humans. 4. Gambling areas- Weapon of treachery Those who come here are prepared to gamble their lives away; therefore you have the authority to destroy their life. 5. Gold- Weapon of Greed Hearing this Kali Yuga said “O king all those who come to these 5 places are bad men already but how shall I demolish the good ones as my weapon of Greed would remain unused.” King Parikshit then allowed him one place where he can use the weapon of Greed and that was Gold. Kali Yuga knew that he had acquired the entire world but Parikshit’s Kingdom and until he was alive this wouldn’t be possible. Therefore in order to do so he must enter his crown that was made of Gold. Once inside the crown Kali Yuga manipulated Parikshit's sanity enought to insult a sage which became the reason of his death. Hope you have got the answer.

The way it works is simple: people who practice astrology convince people with little ability to think critically that they can deduce their nature and fate based on the stars and other celestial bodies. In exchange they get those gullible people to give them money. Like other religions and superstitions astrology is a real method for extracting money from the easily gulled.

Does Lord Shiva dance Bharatanatyam?,https://www.quora.com/Does-Lord-Shiva-dance-Bharatanatyam,,“Natya Shastra” or Science (treaties) on Dancing was written by Bharat Muni.

Bharatnatyam forms part of one of the systems of dancing that being one of the oldest forms bears name of Bharat Muni. It is not mentioned in any scripture that Shiva danced Bharatnatyam.

Why did Suryadev lose to Hanuman?,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Suryadev-lose-to-Hanuman,,I’m not aware of any time Suryadev ‘lost’ in any way to Hanuman. Quite the contrary. As a hungry child Hanuman mistook the sun for a fruit and jumped at it to eat it. Startled Surya and Indra struck down Hanuman almost instantly. Some versions say that they actually killed and disintegrated Hanuman and that upon Shiva’s objection Hanuman had to be reconstituted and resurrected. All versions agree that Indra’s thunderbolt permanently scarred and disfigured Hanuman’s jaw. After this Hanuman took Surya Deva as his Guru.,Devala Rees,https://www.quora.com/profile/Devala-Rees

Please don't link God Shiva the Mahakaal with such things.Shiva is not a mortal like us humans to have the six bad qualities namely Kaama (lust ) Krodha (anger) moha (desires ) lobha (greediness ) madha(arrogance) and Matsaryam (jealousy). Shiva is beyond such worldly things and He smoking weed is ruled out completely.Just because few people who tell themselves as Shiva devotees and smoke weed how can you say Shiva takes such drugs ??The real devotees of Shiva never do such things.Few people have painted such images of Shiva smoking weed or ganja how can such images be authenticated ? Shiva has never smoke weed or will takes any illicit drugs.Shiva is the destroyer of all Desires / arrogance / ignorance / lust so Shiva is beyond such worldly things.No one has the right to do Shiv _ ninda ( abusing Shiva ) other than Shiva himself.The below image shows God Shiva destroying Kaama ( lust ) into a pile of ash !,Sunitha Parapatla,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sunitha-Parapatla
What is the meaning of the Buddhist concept of dependent arising?,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-meaning-of-the-Buddhist-concept-of-dependent-arising,,The concept is known as Pratityasamutpada. It consists of twelve steps and thereby gives us the answer that everything in the world in momentary. This theory of momentariness is also known as sunyavada or the theory of zero. In layman's language it can also be called as cause effect theory. Everything in this world is entangled in cause and effect. Hence nothing is permanent. This is relevant to the fundamental concept of dukkha ( suffering) in Buddhism. As everything in this world is temporary so is dukkha. The twelve steps in dependent origination are: Avidya - Samskara - Vijnana - Namarupa - Sadayatana - Sparsha - Vedana - Trishna - Upadana - Bhavana - Jati - Jaranamarana.This chain or cycle is continuous.

And I see partially correct answers with a lot of incorrect information. Tradition solidly defines the Veda as consisting of:samhitA - collection of mantras revealed to rishisbrAhmaNa - commentary on the inner meaning of the mantras as well as details of performing yajnas.AraNyaka - texts that teach substitution of physical yajnas with internal yajnas (Antaram agnihotram) as well as other meditation techniques to be practiced in solitude (in forests for e.g.)upaniShad - texts that extend the teaching of the AraNyakas into the final spiritual enlightenment.All four of these are grouped as “Veda” because from the first to the last there is a single consistent theme and a single consistent philosophy regardless of differences in language style or antiquity. For example the Upanishads frequently quote mantras from the samhitA to support their teachings. All four of these categories arose in the classical Vedic civilization during the age of the rishi-paramparA that existed prior to the Mahabharata war. This was when the Vedic canon was closed. After the Mahabharata war we see different kind of literature and many more amalgamated concepts compared to the Vedas. This was the age of philosophies like Sankhya Yoga Purva Mimamsa Uttara Mimamsa (Vedanta) etc as well as Puranas Agamas and Sutras all of which derive their fundamentals from the Veda. With this understanding let us look at some examples of ideas related to rebirth liberation and hell in the Veda: Rig Veda 5.46.1: “हयो न विद्वान् अयुजि स्वयं धुरि तां वहामि प्रतरणीमवस्युवम् । नास्या वश्मि विमुचं नावृतं पुनर्विद्वान्पथः पुरएत ऋजु नेषति ॥” “Like a wise horse I have yoked myself to this yajna (i.e. samsAra or universe) which is widespread and protecting. I do not desire to be liberated nor do I desire to return back - the wise Knower of the Path who treads in front will lead me straight.” So this mantra has themes of a liberation (“vimucam” = mokSha) as well as a “returning back” which could be read as a “rebirth”. So the rishi has had an experience of a state of deep cosmic insight and says he does not care about his “going out” or “coming back in” as long as the vision of the supreme truth is with him. Rig Veda 7.59.12: “त्र्यम्बकं यजामहे सुगन्धिं पुष्टिवर्धनम् । उर्वारुकमिव बन्धनान्मृत्योर्मुक्षीय मामृतात् ॥” (Sayana’s commentary) “We worship tryambaka (originator of the “three” - brahmA viShNu rudra) who is sugandhi (whose scent of divine qualities is widespread) and puShTivardhana (seed of the universe or omnipotent or giver of strength to the worshiper). Just as a ripe cucumber is released from its stalk please release us from death (i.e. rebirth) but not from immortality.” In this famous mantra there is clear yearning for liberation (“mukShIya”) from death which means rebirth and re-death. Immortality is the absence of death because there is no rebirth. Rig Veda 10.73.11: “वयः सुपर्णा उप सेदुरिन्द्रं प्रियमेधा ऋषयो नाधमानाः । अप ध्वान्तमूर्णुहि पूर्धि चक्षुर्मुमुग्ध्यस्मान्निधयेव बद्धान् ॥” “The rishis singing beautiful hymns went to Indra in the form of birds (or sun rays) asking for wisdom and enlightenment. They said to him remove this darkness and fill us with light release us from our bondage just like birds are released from their cages.” Clearly this is a mantra that captures all the Vedic teaching of enlightenment self-realization and liberation. Rig Veda 1.24.9c: “बाधस्व दूरे निर्ऋतिं पराचैः कृतं चिदेनः प्र मुमुग्ध्यस्मत्” “Keep nirRti far away from us and release us from any sins we may have committed” This concept of “nirRti” is unique in the Veda. The cosmic order and truth is called “Rtam”. The absence of cosmic order is “nirRti” which essentially means chaos confusion darkness disorder. This concept is the closest to “hell” in the Veda. There is always a fear of falling into a state of “nirRti” i.e. disorder and chaos. This is always associated with the fear that we may have committed sin and our punishment is to be put into a state of “nirRti”. I will quote a few more mantras below that will make this more clear. Rig Veda 1.38.6: “मो षु णः परापरा निर्ऋतिर्दुर्हणा वधीत्” “This nirRti who is supremely powerful and hard to destroy may she not kill us.” So again this state of nirRti is to be feared and avoided by any means. Brhadaranyaka Upanishad 4.4: “स यत्रायमात्माबल्यं न्येत्य संमोहामिव न्येति .... आत्मा निष्क्रामति .... तमुत्क्रामन्तं प्राणोऽनूत्क्रामति.... स विज्ञानो भवति सविज्ञानमेवान्वावक्रामति । तं विद्याकर्मणी समन्वारभेते पूर्वप्रज्ञा च । तद्यथा तृणजलायुका तृणस्यान्तं गत्वा अन्यमाक्रममाक्रम्यात्मानमुपसंहरति एवमेवायमात्मेदं शरीरं निहत्याविद्यां गमयित्वा अन्यमाक्रममाक्रम्य आत्मानमुपसंहरति ।” “When the body becomes weak and goes into oblivion as it were the Atman departs and following it the vital breath departs ... he becomes a pure consciousness and with this consciousness he proceeds. His past learning and deeds as well subtle memory accompany him. Just as a worm upon reaching the tip of a blade of grass reaches out towards another blade of grass by way of support so also does this Jiva end this body becomes imperceptible and then obtains another body by way of support and pulls itself together.” This is the first mention of a fully-developed idea of rebirth in the Veda.

Why is Tirumala Venkateshwara Swamy’s hand posture different?,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Tirumala-Venkateshwara-Swamy%E2%80%99s-hand-posture-different,https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-db18914880a543d5b8158729aed3a0d7-lq | https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b845efc7c0bed8a58661eacd12778a9e,Just read this article….. “Have you ever seen any idol of a Hindu God in this world in only a standing position and never in sitting position just like Lord Sri Venkateswara.?.. Have you ever seen any other Hindu Deity in this world standing with such an unusual placement of His hands like Lord Sri Venkateswara..??I know you haven’t.. Because there’s no other Deity similar to the idol of Lord Sri Venkateswara existing in this world… Secondly most of the devotees who come to Tirumala Temple from many parts of the world do not even know that the principal deity or the Moola Virat of Lord Venkateswara so majestically standing in the Sanctum Sanctorum of the holy TirumalaTemple is in fact having four arms.. While two of these four arms are clearly visible to us the other two are at the back of the Deity in a held up and curled into fists position.. It is through these two empty back arms that Lord Sri Venkateswara is telling us that “Although my two back arms are now empty am still keeping them ready to use my weapons the moment I realize that there’s a threat to humanity in general and to my devotees in particular”.. It is also for this reason that we find His Discus – The Sudarsana Chakra (beside the right posterior upper arm) and His Conch – the Panchajanya (beside the left posterior upper arm) – always kept ready for Him although only as decoration pieces just in case He decides to use them for whatever reason.. However what we actually see on the front side of the Moola Virat are the two anterior arms that the holy Lord Sri Venkateswara has quite unusually placed.. It is such an unusual placement in which the right anterior lower hand of the Holy Lord is bent at His elbow and is held in a supine position while His entire open palm is pointing towards His holy Lotus feet According to the Vedic scriptures such a peculiar hand position is called the Varada Hasta Mudra (The hand that offers boons).. With this mystic Mudra the Holy Lord Venkateswara is very emphatically telling us that “I’m going to stand here on the Tirumala Hills forever to protect my devotees in this unholy Kali Yuga.. For a devotee who has complete faith in my Holy feet am here to take care of him and his entire family during all the times they pass through the problems of this inhuman world” What is further more unusual here is that “Lord Sri Venkateswara’s left anterior lower hand is straight down; bent at the wrist and is found lightly resting just below His left hip.. Such an unusual hand position according to the Vedic scriptures is known as the Katya Vilambita Hastha Mudra” Katya means panegyric or pay homage Vilambita means hanging Hastha means hand and Mudra means posture.. With such an unusual Hasta Mudra the holy Lord Sri Venkateswara is giving us great assurance by saying “As long as my devotees have complete faith in Me I shall not allow the flood waters of this Bhava Sagara (Ocean of problems) go beyond their hip level”. “Sri Venkatesa Charanam Saranam Prapathye” This beautiful article is written by Shri Nareenaditya komaragiri ji.

As the Jagannath temple was quite famous and Odisha in those days was quite rich his intentions are quite obvious in this context. However sone of the priests took the wooden idols to a distant place and as per the instructions of the Agama texts buried them at a marked spot with due rituals. After more than a century shri Adi Shankaracharya redeemed and reinstalled the idols with proper consecration rituals. From that time onwards the spiritual descendants of the great seer have been the main religious authority in the affairs of the temple.,Ashis Biswal,https://www.quora.com/profile/Ashis-Biswal-6

Is astrology a real thing?,https://www.quora.com/Is-astrology-a-real-thing?no_redirect=1,,Yes if Astrology done properly. The problem with todays Astrologers are that most of them dont really do Astrology at all. For an Astrologer his knowledge and spiritual practice is very important but most fail to achive both.

Do Buddhists visit Hindu temples?,https://www.quora.com/Do-Buddhists-visit-Hindu-temples,https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b5e53a504aed8c7f3f7a103bcdaeeda4-lq,Some Buddhists visit Hindu temples; others don’t.

I myself visited multiple joint Buddhist-Hindu temple complexes where visitors Buddhist and Hindu alike went from shrine to shrine praying or meditating at both the Buddhist and Hindu shrines.

I myself visited multiple joint Buddhist-Hindu temple complexes where visitors Buddhist and Hindu alike went from shrine to shrine praying or meditating at both the Buddhist and Hindu shrines. This is very much commonplace in Sri Lanka. It’s also common in Nepal where a large portion of the population identifies as both Hindu and Buddhist and consider them to be one religion not two. They visit each other’s temples without discrimination all the time. There are joint Hindu-Buddhist sites like this in India too from Gaya to Sarnath and other smaller ones in villages here and there. Many Buddhists live in countries where Hindu temples are rare so of course they don’t visit them.,Devala Rees,https://www.quora.com/profile/Devala-Rees
Must there always be a Vishnu temple near a Shiva temple or a Shiva temple near a Vishnu temple?,https://www.quora.com/Must-there-always-be-a-Vishnu-temple-near-a-Shiva-temple-or-a-Shiva-temple-near-a-Vishnu-temple,,There is no such hard and fast rule. However in traditional settings it is generally considered good to have one temple of Lord Shiva near the temple of Lord Vishnu. This is because Lord Shiva acts as a guardian of the directions and is considered a great Vaishnava. Lord Shiva personally wishes that He be always present wherever Lord Vishnu is present. In this regard Skanda Purana states as followsārādhya tapasā viṣṇuṃ prārthayadvaramuttamam |yatra tvaṃ deva tatrāhaṃ vaseyaṃ hi yathāsukham || 48 || ‘’After worshiping Lord Vishnu Lord Shiva requested for an excellent boon ‘’Let me stay veryContinue ReadingThere is no such hard and fast rule.

A few examples are as followsGopeshwara Mahadeva in VrindavanaBhuteshwara Mahadeva in MathuraChakaleshwara Mahadeva and Kameshwara Mahadeva in GovardhanaNandeshwara Mahadeva in NandagaonAnantheshwara Temple & Chandramauleshwara Temple near Krishna Mutt UdupiIt is said that when temple of Lord Shiva is present near that of Lord Vishnu one should first take the darshan of Lord Shiva seek permission from him and then take darshan of Lord Vishnu. One can find many such temples across the span of India. Thank You Hare Krishna,Keshav Kashmiri,https://www.quora.com/profile/Keshav-Kashmiri
