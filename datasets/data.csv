RelatedWhat are some famous places in Vrindavan?,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-famous-places-in-Vrindavan,,I’d suggest you don’t go to Vrindavan as a tourist but as a seeker. The land of Vrindavan has got the sweetness in every step - just look beyond the material clutter which present-day conditions have created. As for your question Shri Bankey Bihari Temple and Sri Sri Krishna Balarama Mandir (ISKCON - Vrindavan) are undoubtedly two of the most famous places. But apart from it here’s a list: Shri Radha Raman temple (self-manifested deity from almost 500 years back!) Shri Radha Madan-mohan temple (this is protected by the ASI) Shri Radha Damodar temple Shri Radha Shyamsundar temple Imlitala Keshi Ghat Nidhivan Chir Ghat Shri Rang ji temple Shahji temple Shri Radha Gopinath temple Gopeshwar Mahadev temple Vamsivat Shringarvat These are only few of the places you can go to in Vrindavan. If you look up Gaudiya Vaishnavism you’ll see the significance of few of the temples mentioned above. There’s a short movie set in Vrindavan called Reconnection. Would highly recommend watching it. It has won several awards and nominations worldwide. Here’s the link :,Radhika Sachdeva,https://www.quora.com/profile/Radhika-Sachdeva-2

Service to one's parents and to guests is mainly based on the fact that both your elders and saintly visiting sadhus can bless you with valuable knowledge. In Vedic culture and society elderly parents remained at home only if unable to fulfill the requirements of vanaprastha and sannyasa generally because of frail health but lived a retired life of austerity and meditation. Travelers who went to take shelter in the house of grihasthis were generally pilgrims or itinerant (parivrajaka) sadhus. On the other hand wealthy tourists and merchants traveled in self sufficient caravans not unlike modern day campers. Of course if your biological parents or elders happen to be senile and degraded criminals who have no sense of ethics or morality any type of guest and even any other decent person will be more deserving of your service. Similarly if you happen to be visited by some arrogant and ignorant fool who wants to exploit your good will to easily get free accommodation and food without any trace of reciprocation you should certainly prefer to offer service to your own parents even if they are not exactly perfect people. Another aspect of the issue is that both one's parents and visiting guests are usually in need of assistance because they are not self sufficient for some reason. In that case if you need to choose you should give priority to those whose need is greater. But I don't see why you can't give service to both categories equally.,Parama Devi,https://www.quora.com/profile/Parama-Devi

Once the four Pandavas (except Yudhishthira who was not present) asked Krishna: ""What is Kaliyuga and what will happen during Kaliyuga?"" Krishna smiled and said ""Let me demonstrate to you the situation of Kaliyuga."" He took a bow and four arrows and shot them in four directions and ordered the four Pandavas to go and bring them back. Each of the four Pandavas went in the four different directions to search for the arrows. When Arjuna picked an arrow he heard a very sweet voice. He turned around and saw a cuckoo singing in a spellbinding voice but was also eating flesh of a live rabbit which was in great pain. Arjuna was very surprised to see such a gory act by such a divine bird he left the place immediately. Bhima picked arrow from a place where five wells were situated. The four wells were surrounding a single well. The four wells were overflowing with very sweet water as if they were not able to hold water and surprisingly the well in the middle of these four overflowing wells was completely empty. Bhima was also puzzled at this sight. Nakula was returning to the place after picking up the arrow. He stopped at a place where a cow was about to give birth. After giving birth the cow started licking the calf but continued to lick it even after the calf was clean. With great difficulty people were able to separate them and by that time the calf was injured badly. Nakula was puzzled by the behaviour of such a calm animal. Sahadeva picked arrow which fell near a mountain and saw a big boulder falling. The boulder was crushing the rocks and big trees on its way down but the same boulder was stopped by a small plant. Sahadeva was also amazed at this sight. All the Pandavas asked the meaning of these incidents. Krishna smiled and started explaining...

On our way just before we reached I woke up and started looking out the window I saw soo many people walking towards Darbar Sahib I was shocked for some reason. I didn't expect any one to be going to the Gurdwara at this time and especially not in the amounts I saw. It was a dark night and a cold one. We reached golden temple the outside lights shining bright. As I climbed up the steps..Slowing I could see the golden reflection As I reached up just before making the descent again I froze. (Shri Darbar sahib is built at lover level of ground than normal ground.) It was a moment like no other…. The beauty. The silence. The peace. Unimaginable words.I couldn't lift my eyes off from Darbar Sahib how perfectly it shined in the Sarovar. I couldn't describe the feeling in a million words. I felt connected I felt near to God. I didn't want to leave that day.. The silence was amazing soo peaceful and blissful. There was no rush no race. Every moment could be enjoyed to its limit. I took soo many photos that day in hope that I could capture the beauty in my phone but it's impossible. It was a experience like no other on the universe.

(RV.10.85.46)The second is from the wedding ceremony itself. The climax and culmination of the Vedic wedding ceremony is when the couple take seven steps together and recite - sakhā sapta-pada bhava - “you are my friend in life through these seven steps”. The couple are exhorted to be friends. Friendship cannot exist if there is a power differential - as master and servant. In the two major opposition religions the wife is the property of her husband. In Hindu law they are united as ONE. The wife is known as ardhāṅgini - meaning the HALF of her husband.etāvān eva puruṣo yat – jāyā – ātmā prajā iti ha | viprāḥ prāhus tathā ca etad yo bhartā sā smṛta aṅganā || A man alone is nothing - he is incomplete. The perfect man is one who is completely united in harmony with his wife and children. These three are ONE. (Manu 9;45.)The third and perhaps of greater importance is also from the Laws of Manu:–arthasya saṅgrahe ca enāṁ vyaye ca eva niyojayet | śauce dharme anna-paktyāṁ ca pāriṇāhyasya vekṣaṇe || The wife must be given the responsibility by the husband of collecting and spending his wealth engaged in maintaining cleanliness of the household of fulfilling the religious obligations of preparing the food. (Manu 9;11.)And why is this of the utmost importance? Because financial empowerment of women is the secret of a prosperous and advanced society. And I challenge my gentle readers to find any religious texts from the opposition parties which financially empower women like some of the Hindu texts do. BUT sadly the reality is different and it is the financial disempowerment of women that is a contributing factor to the poverty in India. India has produced in the past and has some of the most humane and sophisticated laws in the world but implementation has been the perennial problem up to this day.,Rami Sivan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Rami-Sivan

After this land worship many things were done on social media in which the most asked whether there was really a Ram temple in Ayodhya. Ayodhya was ruined after the war of Mahabharata but even during that period the existence of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi was safe and remained intact till about 14th century. According to the facts in 1527-28 on the orders of Babur a mosque was built by demolishing the grand Ram temple built at Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya. A very good anecdote has been found in this subject which is during the hearing of Ram Mandir. Must read this article because no media has told what were the talks during the Ram temple hearing and what facts were presented. Here I am presenting some interesting incidents during the hearing of Ram Mandir. first Incident Judge: - The remains of the walls have been found under the mosque. Lawyer of Muslim side: - Those walls can be of Dargah. Judge :- But your opinion is that the mosque was built on some vacant place not by demolishing any structure. Lawyer of Muslim side :- Silence... Judge :- Some idols have been found in the excavation of SIT. Lawyer of Muslim side: - They can also be children's toys. Judge :- There is also an idol of ""Varaha"" which according to Hindu belief was an incarnation of Lord Vishnu... Was there a practice among Muslims to play with idols..? Lawyer of Muslim side: - Pin Drop silence...!! Second Incident Shri Ram is there in our Vedas as well as his birth place and Ayodhya have also been accurately mentioned. In favor of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Padmavibhushan Jagatguru Rambhadracharya ji (he was blind since the age of two months) was being given evidence from the scriptures in favor of Ram Janmabhoomi. A man sitting in the judge's chair was a Muslim and asked a strange question ""You people ask for proof from Vedas in everything so can you give proof from Vedas that Ram ji was born at the same place in Ayodhya"" On this Ram Bhadra Charya ji said ""I can give sir"" and he started giving examples from the Jaimini Samhita of Rigveda which gave very accurate details of the direction and distance from the particular place of river Sarayu. By order of the court Jaimini Samhita was called and the number mentioned by Rambhadracharya ji was opened and all the mentions were found to be correct. These things became very clear that the disputed place is exactly where the Ram Janmabhoomi should have been and this fact turned the Ram Janmabhoomi decision in favor of the Hindus. The Muslim judge admitted that ""Today I saw the miracle of Indian culture a person who is devoid of material eyes how he was being exemplified by the vast ocean of Vedas and Shastras! If this is not a divine power then what else?

There are usually no sermons or talks by a priest. It can vary widely from temple to temple and even from day to day within a temple. The most common form of worship in most Hindu temples is Puja. The priest(s) perform Puja several times throughout the day at specific times. It generally involves ringing bells passing a flame before the Murtis (ritually enlivened idols) of the Gods chanting mantras making offerings (mainly of water and certain foods) and performing various other ritual actions. Worshippers may come to give thanks to the Divine to ask for assistance to perform penance to contemplate; but most of all to experience the Darshan of the Gods. Darshan literally means sight but it conveys much more. The worshipper makes eye contact with the deity and intensely feels the deity seeing them back like eye contact with a living person. In Darshan one imbibes the energy of the deity and receives blessings. It doesn’t even strictly require eye contact; blind Hindus still speak of “getting Darshan” for example. It’s just a close intimate communion with the deity. The priest mainly assists by fully waking the Murtis and calling their attention so that worshippers may come and have their Darshan. Most offerings are also made by the priest since technical methods and purity requirements usually apply. Sometimes individuals or family groups have specific rituals performed for them at Hindu temples. There is a huge variety of such rituals. Also special Pujas occur on specific days and festivities happen in Hindu temples on the great festival days. There are also other more elaborate rituals such as Homas (also called Yagnyas or Havanas) involving large fire sacrifices. Usually fewer people are allowed to attend these. Essentially Hindu temples serve as dwelling places for deities so that worshippers may come and worship them there with the aid of specialists.,Devala Rees,https://www.quora.com/profile/Devala-Rees

However as per the Torah Solomon's Haykal could be re-built only by a Prophet who would be born amidst them. Jerusalem holds an important historical significance for the Christians since after being born in Bethlehem (Palestine) Jesus Christ was brought to Jerusalem where he lived and preached. Muslims attach importance to Jerusalem on account of the spiritual journey Isra that Prophet Muhammad had undertaken and also due to his changing the direction of prayer from the Ka’ba in Mecca towards Jerusalem for a temporary period. What bridges the gap between followers of these faith is that they have common Prophets. Hence from a historical perspective the Kingdom of Solomon and the birth place of Jesus Christ is indirectly significant to the Muslims.,Maulana Wahiduddin Khan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Maulana-Wahiduddin-Khan-1
RelatedWhat are some interesting facts about RathYatra?,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-interesting-facts-about-RathYatra,,Rath Yatra itself is a very interesting event.Here the God himself behave as a human being.This all started with an event called “snana purnima”.Due to summer heat on the full moon day of Jyosta month All the 3 deities takes full bath.After that they fall sick with fever. So during those days you can find the deities on their thrones in the temple.They undergoes treatment. Once they recovers well they wish to go out to their original birth place and meet their maternal aunt. This is how we humans behave to get relax after a prolonged illness. This is why Rath Yatra is celebrated. All the 3 deities Come out of the temple and visit Gundicha temple. Gundicha temple is named after queen Gundicha. According to legends this is the place where Viswakarma(God of Engineering) created the deities first time.During their journey from Sri Mandir to Gundicha Mandir the chariots stops near the MAUSI MAA TEMPLE(maternal aunt).Here the deities meet their aunt and eat Poda Pitha(it's a kind of pan cake available famous in Odisha). During Rath Yatra some other events are also noticed:The Gajapati kings of Odisha act as sweeper of the chariots.This is a symbolic representation of ancient Odisha rule.When Islamic invaders were crushing northern and central India Odisha rulers were able to hold them for the maximum time till 1568.They were able to unite the Hindu kingdoms by declaring themself as a representative of Lord Jagganath and declaring Lord Jagganath as the ruler of Odisha.Puri is one of the temples which only allows sanatani Hindus inside the temple.Even Indira Gandhi was not allowed.Because this temple was attacked by sultanates or Bengal and Delhi for more than 17 times.But during Rath Yatra anyone can see the deities and participate.This is the time when the main temple is empty. So it is believed that during this time Virabhadra and Bhadrakali protect the temples.There is a good event available online which describes what happened when a YOGI did not believe that the Gods actually go out of the temple during Rath Yatra and he went to the temple to see Lord Jagganath.What events followed is very interesting.Here the Lord takes his siblings (Balabhadra and Subhadra) with him to his birth place. This makes his wife Goddess Laxmi very angry. So after 3 days on “Hera Panchami” she comes with her supporters and beaks the chariot of Lord Jagganath and returns to the main temple without meeting Lord Jagganath. Upon knowing this when Lord Jagganath returns to the main temple  he presents “Rasagolla” (very famous sweet) to Goddess Laxmi to please her. This is a total family story. Is not it?Rath Yatra festival is very connected to Human life and behaviour. This is the speciality about it and very famous around the world.,Milan Bhatta,https://www.quora.com/profile/Milan-Bhatta

People think it because the same word is used as gender identifying symbol in Sanskrit. The word ‘lingam’ in Sanskrit means symbol. So how did it become phallus? In Sanskrit all the words are perfectly made with root words (dhatu) and ending parts (Pratyay). Generally the Pratyays don't have any meaning as they are only the ending parts not the main word. But some Pratyays have symbolic meaning or indicates something or someone they are the ‘linga Pratyay’ or in short ‘linga’ those ending part of the words that have meaning. These symbols are of different types as - Purush Pratyay Stri Pratyay and others. These Pratyays or symbols are added to the ending part of words to identify the person is male female or neutar gender. And by time people made such mistakes. If it was Phallus then how could the word Stri linga come for indicating female gender? What does the scriptures say about Lingam? The Linga Purana one of the 18 Mahapurana in its Third Chapter says that ""The formless Supreme being(Brahma or Brahman) is Lingam. Mahadev is that Supreme being formless and Nirguna form him all the Indescribable things appeared. The greatest lingam holds two parts - the Pradhana (principal) and the Prakriti (nature). The foremost lingam is devoid of colour test touch smell and vibration or sound truly Shiva is alinga(formless or without symbol). Again he himself are the Pancha Bhutas Pancha Tamnatras taking the form of the lingam. And from this lingam the cause of this creation Vishnu Brahma and Shiva arose."" In the 129th suktam (Nasadiya Suktam) of the 10th Mandal of Rigveda ""In the beginning of the creation there was nothing. Ishwara was there only as the soul (Atma or Atman) without any symbol. There arose desire in His mind and from that everything was created.""It means everything was concentrated in a place at first. In the same Suktam of 10th Mandal of Rigveda it is said that the lingam at first started spreading up and down (which shows that the concentrated thing then took the shape of a cosmic pillar) then to its sides.It is also said in the Lingodbhava Chapter of Linga/Shiva Purana. Yogasikha Upanishad says ""This lingam is itself the creator and the creation."" If you carefully observe the Shiva lingam then you will surely fond two sets of stages on which the main Lingam stands. Why are the stages present under the lingam? What is there importance? The answer is right beside the Lingam itself it is the 'Trishul' (trident) of Shiva which indicates three qualities of the World- 1. Satwa 2. Raja and 3. Tama. These three gunas or qualities form the lingam from the base as-  1. The base or Bhumi bhag- It is the Satwik part where Lord Brahma resides. It shows the peace that remain when one is remaining under the shade of God following him in every steps of life. 2. The upper stage or Pitham- It is the container of the God with Raja guna i.e. Lord Vishnu. Vishnu remaining here holds the Supreme being above and protects the creator and creation under. The stage contains a drainage system which shows the characteristics of Lord Vishnu as a provider of Moksha (eternal salvation). Here the water indicates the life and flow of water indicates the following of the path of God helps one attaining Moksha. These two parts are togetherly is the 'Prakriti bhag'. It is the part indicating Mother Durga who is the better half of Shiva. It indicates our mother nature holds us in her. 3. The Rudra bhag- It is the Tamasik part where the Purusha (the Supreme being) resides. Linga Purana says that Shiva remains in this part in samadhi or the highest stage of meditation as the most peaceful Sambhu.Atharvaveda mentions about this part as the cosmic pillar where the Paramatma is worshipped. The Trident of Shiva are these three Gods who are unitedly the Supreme being or Paramatma. And the drum (damru) shows the cosmic vibration which helped in the creation. The lingam is also an example of the Yoga shastra. The lingam indicates the the 'Sushumna' the sensational of the living beings. The 'Ira' and 'Pingala' are indicated by the snake which rise above the lingam coiling it 3 and a half times. In the Shiva lingam the seven chakras of kundalini remains fully active. And so it is the most powerful thing which makes a person spiritually awaken and brings peace in mind.[If you need proof then go to a Shiva Temple which is soundless and without doing anything just sit before the lingam. You can feel it by yourself.] In the end if we co relate the stort of Nrisingha Purana then we find that Lord Vishnu also came out of a pillar to save the human civilization. It indicates all the Gods are residing together in the Shiva lingam. The Lingam is the corporeal form of the formless Ishwara. How? It is the form of Shiva in which the form of Shiva is remained incorporeal but it contains form of a pillar. So here God is both corporeal and formless being. And the 'Tripundra' drawn indicates the heaven the earth and the hell all are from him.So if you understand all these then you can surely understand that the whole world is the lingam and the great saying of Skanda Purana ""Even the sky is a lingam"" The Shiva lingam present in the temples are nothing but the activated form of the main lingam where Shiva is surely present and active.",Pallab Sen,https://www.quora.com/profile/%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%B2%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%AC-%E0%A6%B8%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%A8-Pallab-Sen

At first it is well known that Mahadeva has 12 Jyotirlingas everyone of them stands for the different attributes of Mahadeva. In the Sahasranama Lord Shiva is described as Akshayaguna it means the one who has unlimited attributes or qualities. Being Mahakaaleshwar is one of those attributes. Mahakaaleshwar means the Ishwar of timeline the Lord who controls the flow of time. Now what are the characteristics of time? To create something you need time to preserve something you need time & to destroy something you need time. So basically the Time leads or guides the entire existence in it's path from creation to destruction. Destruction is the ultimate step which is leaded by the timeline. During destruction everything becomes one thing variety becomes unity. Destruction annihilates the Prakriti or Nature of everything that was existing leaving behind the ashes. If you think conceptually then you'll find that the ash is actually the purest form of material because it doesn't have any kind of mixture in it it's just pure ash no matter what it was before no matter how many types of materials was there before destruction after destruction it's only pure ash nothing else. Shiva himself use to wrap his body in ash. Because the nature of ash is unchangeable non dual & imperishable just like Shiva. “The materialistic properties of this existence is temporary Prakriti is temporary everything that exists within timeline is temporary but Shiva the Purusha the Lord of the Timeline is permanent non dual unchangeable & imperishable” - that's the message. It is even written in SV Upanishad “Prakriti is perishable Hara the Lord is imperishable”. So to signify the permanent pure unchangeable non dual & imperishable nature of the Mahakaaleshwar attribute of Lord Shiva the Bhashma Arati is specifically performed in this Jyotirlinga.Hope you found my answer to be a worthy one.

Teachings of Bhagavad Gita are still applicable and relevant in every step of our life. Its teachings are considered to be ultimate truth. It encompasses each and every aspect of life. Bhagavad Gita. shows path to the lost answer to the confused and wisdom to all. The primary purpose of the Bhagavad- Gita is to illuminate for all of humanity the realization of the true nature of divinity; for the highest spiritual conception and the greatest material perfection is to attain love of Lord! Some of the most popular and important teachings of Bhagvad Gita are as under:- Bhagwaan Sri Krishna said that a lot about meditation and it’s importance. Meditation is considered extremely helpful for inner peace and ‘sadhna’ of human being. Moreover a person who thinks about earning money such person ceases the right to be Yogi or Bhakta of Bhagwaan. Desires or lust come and go but we should remain a dispassionate witness simply watching and enjoying the show. We should not be under its influence. Everyone experiences desires but one should not be moved by them. People sometimes undertake really evil actions because of their desires. So one should not come under the chains of desires and lust. Those who guided by it are sufferers of Narkak also. Bhagwaan Sri Krishna says to Arjuna that he is the supreme personality Godhead. He is the original cause of all causes. He starts everything and ends everything too. He is omnipresent and omnipotent infinite unborn ultimate truth also. He is divine and transcendental. We should not repent of our past or worry and also about the future as the present is going on. We should note that Lord has already planned everything for us. He will not let anything bad happen to us. We should be optimistic and should not stress our self with these baseless worries of past and future. If things are not favorable they are surely the fruit of Past Karma. What we get good omen or bad things are due to our present and past Karma. Human Soul is totally free from the cycle of 84 lakhs different Yoni but as human beings follow the nature three qualities like Satvik Rajsi or Tamsi attitude of Nature it pulls human beings into Narak or heaven or also the cause of birth in royal family or poor family. Everything is under the boundary of Karma so no one can be freed from the Bhav Bandhan of death and rebirth cycle. There is only one karma which has no boundary. So human beings should always try to do every Karma for the Supreme Personality Lord Vishnu. Otherwise no one is free from 84 Lakhs of cycle. There are more things we can learn. /Jai Sri Ram/,Virendra Kumar Sharma,https://www.quora.com/profile/Virendra-Kumar-Sharma

Outside of India you can find Hindus Sikhs and Jains eating diets they never did in India. I have noticed that most Hindus and Sikhs who emigrated from India after the mid 1990s for the most part did not make profound changes in their diet. Indian foods became widely available in the West and even more so after the 2000s. There became little reason to give up their diet of choice. This is in profound contrast to Indians who came to the West in the 1950’s though the 1980s. For them diet changes were necessary to survive. Though people such as my mother never changed her diet and endured a great deal of hardship. Eating Beef however is a debatable issue for Sikhs on the one hand Baba Guru Nanak Dev Ji came from the Bedi family which was Hindu. And he did not advocate violence towards animals. The following Sikh Gurus never encouraged the eating of meat. In fact even today Sikh Guanis and those in the employ of Sikh Temples do not eat meat. A Sikh Gurudwara will never serve meat on it’s premises. The environment of India is as such and religion is inseparably linked to the reduction of suffering and violence. There are voices who wish to establish that eating Beef is permissible for Sikhs and to thus bring emphasis to their separate identity. The idea is not founded in a really genuine intent Baba Guru Nanak Dev Ji spoke of tolerance and inclusion. To emphasise the killing of an Animal which is sacred for most in India is not even approaching tolerance nor inclusion. There are many other things to eat in India and pushing forward a divisive tendency is not productive. However when they do consume meat it cannot be “halal” or “kosher” meat but “jhatka” where the animal has ...,Baba Vickram Aditya Bedi,https://www.quora.com/profile/Baba-Vickram-Aditya-Bedi

And I see partially correct answers with a lot of incorrect information. Tradition solidly defines the Veda as consisting of:samhitA - collection of mantras revealed to rishisbrAhmaNa - commentary on the inner meaning of the mantras as well as details of performing yajnas.AraNyaka - texts that teach substitution of physical yajnas with internal yajnas (Antaram agnihotram) as well as other meditation techniques to be practiced in solitude (in forests for e.g.)upaniShad - texts that extend the teaching of the AraNyakas into the final spiritual enlightenment.All four of these are grouped as “Veda” because from the first to the last there is a single consistent theme and a single consistent philosophy regardless of differences in language style or antiquity. For example the Upanishads frequently quote mantras from the samhitA to support their teachings. All four of these categories arose in the classical Vedic civilization during the age of the rishi-paramparA that existed prior to the Mahabharata war. This was when the Vedic canon was closed. After the Mahabharata war we see different kind of literature and many more amalgamated concepts compared to the Vedas. This was the age of philosophies like Sankhya Yoga Purva Mimamsa Uttara Mimamsa (Vedanta) etc as well as Puranas Agamas and Sutras all of which derive their fundamentals from the Veda. With this understanding let us look at some examples of ideas related to rebirth liberation and hell in the Veda: Rig Veda 5.46.1: “हयो न विद्वान् अयुजि स्वयं धुरि तां वहामि प्रतरणीमवस्युवम् । नास्या वश्मि विमुचं नावृतं पुनर्विद्वान्पथः पुरएत ऋजु नेषति ॥” “Like a wise horse I have yoked myself to this yajna (i.e. samsAra or universe) which is widespread and protecting. I do not desire to be liberated nor do I desire to return back - the wise Knower of the Path who treads in front will lead me straight.” So this mantra has themes of a liberation (“vimucam” = mokSha) as well as a “returning back” which could be read as a “rebirth”. So the rishi has had an experience of a state of deep cosmic insight and says he does not care about his “going out” or “coming back in” as long as the vision of the supreme truth is with him. Rig Veda 7.59.12: “त्र्यम्बकं यजामहे सुगन्धिं पुष्टिवर्धनम् । उर्वारुकमिव बन्धनान्मृत्योर्मुक्षीय मामृतात् ॥” (Sayana’s commentary) “We worship tryambaka (originator of the “three” - brahmA viShNu rudra) who is sugandhi (whose scent of divine qualities is widespread) and puShTivardhana (seed of the universe or omnipotent or giver of strength to the worshiper). Just as a ripe cucumber is released from its stalk please release us from death (i.e. rebirth) but not from immortality.” In this famous mantra there is clear yearning for liberation (“mukShIya”) from death which means rebirth and re-death. Immortality is the absence of death because there is no rebirth. Rig Veda 10.73.11: “वयः सुपर्णा उप सेदुरिन्द्रं प्रियमेधा ऋषयो नाधमानाः । अप ध्वान्तमूर्णुहि पूर्धि चक्षुर्मुमुग्ध्यस्मान्निधयेव बद्धान् ॥” “The rishis singing beautiful hymns went to Indra in the form of birds (or sun rays) asking for wisdom and enlightenment. They said to him remove this darkness and fill us with light release us from our bondage just like birds are released from their cages.” Clearly this is a mantra that captures all the Vedic teaching of enlightenment self-realization and liberation. Rig Veda 1.24.9c: “बाधस्व दूरे निर्ऋतिं पराचैः कृतं चिदेनः प्र मुमुग्ध्यस्मत्” “Keep nirRti far away from us and release us from any sins we may have committed” This concept of “nirRti” is unique in the Veda. The cosmic order and truth is called “Rtam”. The absence of cosmic order is “nirRti” which essentially means chaos confusion darkness disorder. This concept is the closest to “hell” in the Veda. There is always a fear of falling into a state of “nirRti” i.e. disorder and chaos. This is always associated with the fear that we may have committed sin and our punishment is to be put into a state of “nirRti”. I will quote a few more mantras below that will make this more clear. Rig Veda 1.38.6: “मो षु णः परापरा निर्ऋतिर्दुर्हणा वधीत्” “This nirRti who is supremely powerful and hard to destroy may she not kill us.” So again this state of nirRti is to be feared and avoided by any means. Brhadaranyaka Upanishad 4.4: “स यत्रायमात्माबल्यं न्येत्य संमोहामिव न्येति .... आत्मा निष्क्रामति .... तमुत्क्रामन्तं प्राणोऽनूत्क्रामति.... स विज्ञानो भवति सविज्ञानमेवान्वावक्रामति । तं विद्याकर्मणी समन्वारभेते पूर्वप्रज्ञा च । तद्यथा तृणजलायुका तृणस्यान्तं गत्वा अन्यमाक्रममाक्रम्यात्मानमुपसंहरति एवमेवायमात्मेदं शरीरं निहत्याविद्यां गमयित्वा अन्यमाक्रममाक्रम्य आत्मानमुपसंहरति ।” “When the body becomes weak and goes into oblivion as it were the Atman departs and following it the vital breath departs ... he becomes a pure consciousness and with this consciousness he proceeds. His past learning and deeds as well subtle memory accompany him. Just as a worm upon reaching the tip of a blade of grass reaches out towards another blade of grass by way of support so also does this Jiva end this body becomes imperceptible and then obtains another body by way of support and pulls itself together.” This is the first mention of a fully-developed idea of rebirth in the Veda.

Thus the orally redacted Samhita has been proved to be unchangeable. This means that no modification has been done or can be done to Vedas or Vedic hymns since the date of redaction and organization to different branches. Regarding modifications before time of redaction the modern linguistic studies have yielded evidence that not much change has happened except for slight variations in pronunciations of syllables which are natural and do not affect meaning. (whether you pronounce retroflex “L” as “D” or “Zh” you know it means and refers to the same letter) Once they have been composed people on redaction have taken collections of different hymns and organized them into different collections called “Samhitas”. Some of the Samhitas have been thought to be lost due to break in tradition but chief samhitas of four Vedas are still preserved intact. Thus simply you can’t alter Vedas.

Since only 1 person has answered my question (and that too is a 1-line answer) I guess I’ll have to go ahead and speculate from what I can find online.After the historic judgement of the Supreme Court on the Babri Masjid-Ram Janbhoomi dispute some Hindus believe that other temples which were demolished to construct mosques deserve justice too. This was shared on the Indian right-wing space :The article mentions Ram Janmabhoomi Temple — Babri Masjid Kashi Vishwanath Temple — Gyanvapi Mosque Krishna Janmabhoomi Temple — Shahi Idgah Mosque Rudra Mahalaya — Jami Masjid Bhojshala — Kamal Maula Mosque Adinath Temple — Adina Mosque Bhadrakali Temple — Jama Masjid Vijay Temple — Bijamandal Mosque Somnath Temple and Several Hindu & Jain Temples — Quwwat al-Islam Mosque in Qutub Minar complex. While it is a good thing to know about one’s history I honestly don’t get the obsession of trying to “correct historical wrongs”. The gentleman who shared the article says that the only way forward is “legal reclamation” of the sites mentioned above; and it only means that he and the hundreds of people who upvoted it want temples to be restored there. And comments on social media sites would prove that they’re not the only ones who feel that way.Thankfully political leaders are more sensible and responsible than the average citizen:Replying to a query about whether the RSS would push “for Kashi and Mathura” now that the Ayodhya dispute had been settled by the Supreme Court RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat said: “The Sangh doesn’t get involved in any movement (andolan). We work towards character building. “In the past the circumstances were different resulting in the Sangh getting involved in the movement (Ayodhya). We will once again work for character building.”Source : RSS won’t push Varanasi Mathura mosque issues after Ayodhya verdict says Mohan Bhagwat,Deepak Purti,https://www.quora.com/profile/Deepak-Purti

So later on did Ganesha forgive his father Lord Shiva?,https://www.quora.com/Lord-Shiva-killed-Ganesha-in-anger-So-later-on-did-Ganesha-forgive-his-father-Lord-Shiva,,I would like you to think for a moment. Is it possible for all pervading Siva to not know that Ganesha was His son too? What for was his anger? If Siva is God does He not know Parvati created Ganesha and asked him to keep the gates? The answers to these questions a kid had asked will give you satisfactory answers. The story is more allegoric. It makes sense if you understand the point being driven. Otherwise it is a stupid story. Ganesha was made out of mail (waste out of skin or turmeric applied to the skin). Either case Ganesha then represents the jiva buddhi (separation from Iswara) and hence does not realize Siva and Sakti are same and stops Him from entering. Why the head was cut off? Head is where thinking happens. To attach a new head means that Ganesha changed his way of thinking after that and realized Siva and Sakti are not separate. Therefore in another story later when Ganesha was asked to go around the globe he did go around his parents and said that’s done. This is a story of a person from being egoistic to devotee or Jnani. Nothing more nothing less. Don’t keep digging into the story to find sense out of it. Most of the stories from Puranas intend to give these kind of messages. Lastly since you asked if Ganesha forgave his father he has a name called “heramba” - one of its meanings being a son who always prefers to stay with his father. Hope this helps.

You’re definitely going to want medical attention if you can get it! As to what happens longer term that’s really going to depend on the nature of the injury. Low energy projectile might just make a hole that’s amenable to packing cautery or other local measures to stop bleeding. It could even clot on its own. If there are no signs of serious bleeding or complications patient might escape surgery but with any doubt surgeon will want to look around in there to see what kind of injury there is. Injury to biliary system potentially has very serious long term consequences. High energy projectile (eg rifle round) can for lack of a better word “pulpify” the liver and that’s a “problem”. Mortality there can be high. In part because chance of bleeding to death is significant and also because this can’t just be sewed up. Treatment may involve debridement partial liver resection or other measures. “Good news” is that compared to most other organs liver can heal itself relatively well and we can live with only a small fraction of liver. Bad news is there is no “artificial” liver you need it to live and you only have one so unlike (say) a lung or kidney it can’t just be removed.

How is it possible that Hinduism has many gods and goddesses when in ancient times there were only three major gods (Brahma Vishnu and Shiva)?,https://www.quora.com/How-is-it-possible-that-Hinduism-has-many-gods-and-goddesses-when-in-ancient-times-there-were-only-three-major-gods-Brahma-Vishnu-and-Shiva,,Brahman is the source of not only Brahma Vishnu and Shiva but also of everything else. Brahman is the source of countless deities both major and minor. No one knows why Brahman is like that. Universe and gods and goddesses are manifestations of BrahmanThere are two states of this Brahma; one with and one without shape; one perishable and one imperishable; which are inherent in all beings. The imperishable is the supreme being; the perishable is all the world. The blaze of fire burning on one spot diffuses light and heat around; so the world is nothing more than the manifested energy of the supreme Brahma: and inasmuch Maitreya as the light and heat are stronger or feebler as we are near to the fire or far off from it so the energy of the supreme is more or less intense in the beings that are less or more remote from him. Brahma Vishńu and Śiva are the most powerful energies of god; next to them are the inferior deities then the attendant spirits then men then animals birds insects vegetables; each becoming more and more feeble as they are farther from their primitive source. In this way illustrious Brahman this whole world although in essence imperishable and eternal appears and disappears as if it was subject to birth and death. The supreme condition of Brahma which is meditated by the Yogis in the commencement of their abstraction as invested with form is Vishńu composed of all the divine energies and the essence of Brahma with whom the mystic union that is sought and which is accompanied by suitable elements is effected 7 by the devotee whose whole mind is addressed to that object. This Hari who is the most immediate of all the energies of Brahma is his embodied shape composed entirely of his essence; and in him therefore is the whole world interwoven; and from him and in him is the universe; and he the supreme lord of all comprising all that is perishable and imperishable bears upon him all material and spiritual existence identified in nature with his ornaments and weapons.Vishnu Purana I.22.55-65,Pradip Gangopadhyay,https://www.quora.com/profile/Pradip-Gangopadhyay

It has become so prevalent that they have now established themselves globally. Any real accounts or tale of friends would be interesting to read. Iskcon was founded by Srila Prabhupada in New York USA in 1966 so Americans were the first members who joined. Later the world headquarters was established in Mayapur West Bengal but it is an international society not an Indian society so foreigners don’t join Iskcon people of all nationalities join Iskcon in their own countries without ever coming to India. The teachings of Iskcon delivered by Srila Prabhupada come from India and there is an increasing number of foreigners who come and live in India to participate in Iskcon if you are interested in those coming from abroad to live in India I am one of them so I can tell you why I like to be in India as a follower of Prabhupada. I had traveled through quite a few different countries the larger Islands of Indonesia Kalimantan Sarawak Sumatra and Brunei then Singapore Malaysia Thailand as well as Australia New Zealand and half a dozen countries in Europe. I knew about Iskcon and wanted to practice Krishna consciousness in Mayapur the birthplace of Mahaprabhu so I came to India. I thought of myself as quite a seasoned traveler and worldly-wise but I wasn’t really prepared for India. It seems to me that all human traits and characteristics in the world can be found in India. India is both wild and incredibly refined. I’ve been in riots at Sealdah station and College Street where people died and I’ve been in super-wealthy industrialists’ houses with manicured lawns in the center of huge cities. Although I live in Bengal I’ve traveled by train down to Kerala across to Gujarat up to Punjab and over to Manipur with many stops in between I haven’t even scratched the surface of India. So much of India is steeped in ancient history but still she pulsates with the vibrancy and freshness of a modern country. I know Bengal best because I’ve lived here for 35 years and have learned passable Bengali at the village level because I live in a small village of 200 people. Kolkata rocked me at first. It’s common to see groups of men all soaped up in their underwear taking their bath on the pavement as water from the Ganga flows from a hydrant. You can get a shave have your ears cleaned your Hawaiian chapels stitched and your fortune told all on the pavements. I’ve seen Indian women dressed in saris carrying bricks on their heads on building sites and during rest-times breastfeeding their baby. I’ve met Marwaris who control crores of rupees of business sitting on a guddi with only a small desk a landline telephone and an endless stream of runners who come and go with slips of paper or blocks of money wrapped in newspaper. There are gold shops everywhere (South India especially) and few women of any means go out without some gold ornaments. For a while I did some voluntary work for an NGO that was affiliated with CINNI and we worked in the surrounding villages taking care of pregnant women and babies up to the age of three. I was joined at one point by a trained midwife from Scotland who spent time in the Gulf delivering some of the mega rich peoples’ babies. It was a jolt for her to work in the villages and I would accompany her and translate. Sometimes there was no translation. The ladies would say their stomach was going grung grung or their legs felt jing jing or there was krang krang inside their head. We built up a small glossary of terms and I would ask the ladies jing jing korche na krang krang korche? Simple and effective. When I first arrived so much in India seemed so natural. Leaves for plates little clay cups for tea a smoldering rope to light cigarettes a dhob cut in front of you with a few deft strokes of a chopper and then as a tiny concession to modernity a straw inserted into it. Nearly everything was recycled automatically. Where I live life is natural. Some land a cow or two and your own home are normal. No mortgage no debts or loans to pay off. I know it’s not the same everywhere but everyone I know has their own home however small it may be and however many people may be in it. Life is intense in India but in general there is amazing tolerance until it hits flash point and then there is an explosion There is a deep culture of decency and chastity of duty and obligation that I have never seen elsewhere. There are also layers of complacency corruption dishonesty and criminal activities that exist alongside. There is a piety that is unparalleled. It is the only country in the world where the majority has some detailed knowledge of God. Most know what He looks like in one or other of His many forms. People know that the atma is the person and the atma moves from one body to another. They have enough compassion not to kill cows for food. People know all this without compulsory attendance at weekly meetings on a Friday or Sunday for instruction. It’s already in the culture in the histories in the fabric of society. There are dozens of religious festivals throughout the year. Although there are attempts to commercialize some of them for the most part the festivals retain their original purpose to honor some aspect of the Lord or His activities or associates. The Kumbha Mela festivals are so gynormous that the army oversees the organization of them. There are holy places going back thousands or tens of thousands of years dotted everywhere. Tirthas dhams holy rivers sacred trees hills and mountains run the length and breadth of India. In every state I’ve been highly significant things have happened at some time in their glorious past. Indians have an amazing ability to adapt and adjust. Not just the jugaads that are never-ending but attitudes and practices. At first glance many people seem callous as they walk past deformed beggars and baby-clutching women asking for money. But there are just so many unfortunate people or people pretending to be unfortunate that it’s impossible to indulge all of them. However as soon as I get to know a total stranger for five minutes I am swapping phone numbers and promising to stay in touch. There is a deep resilience in the India psyche an ability to face hardship without self-pity and a stoic acceptance of personal misfortune and disturbance. India has survived as a democracy when some analysts doubted she could and some heads of state hoped that she wouldn’t. But here we are. People with a very strong sense of hierarchy all working together as a democracy. A democracy that is slowly giving more women more say in their lives. Not just the educated in the cities but right down to the panchayat level in the countryside. There is a rough and ready culture out in the countryside but it is far from haphazard. Sometimes the rural areas seem medieval but they are not primitive there is depth to the culture that escapes a casual look. A married girl from my village came home last week; she brought her one-year-old grandson with her. She is 29. Huh! 29 and a grandmother? Yes. Is she happy? Yes. Does her husband look after her nicely? Yes. Does she have any say in her life? Yes of course. I have known her since she was three. She chatters and laughs she gets angry sulks and pouts she can twist her husband round her finger if she really wants something but her husband is quite convinced that he is in control. Has she missed out on anything? Well this is where it gets debatable. What should a simple girl from a small village expect from life? To be happy have a loving husband whom she controls with sweet words and her faithfulness; children and grandchildren that she dotes on; insulation from the crazy world affairs like Syria and ISIS. A functional family and festivals all year round to celebrate. Is that not nice for some? It is not for everyone but it is an option in India. She missed out on teenage love affairs and heartbreak on hoping for this guy or that guy as a boyfriend/lover/husband. She didn’t have to struggle in college being a financial burden to her parents desperate to succeed and to pass exams look for a job fend off lusty men and satisfy a boss. She went straight from her father’s home to her husband’s home and gradually made it hers. Moving on. In India there is a difference between being poor and not having much money. The poor suffer and those without much money have dignity and satisfaction with what they have. There are those who don’t worry all the time and strive constantly for more. And then there are others who are hungry for wealth and success in a competitive world. Entrepreneurship is alive and thriving. The numbers of poverty-stricken are reducing the middle-class is growing and Indians are successful in the most successful countries of the world. Of course all the unpleasantness of life exists in India also. Murder rape suicide desolate marriages discrimination exploitation financial tragedy sometimes appalling health care naive people killed and stripped for body parts and all manner of other crimes. India seems to contain the best and worst of everywhere. There are schools of thought and philosophy still being lived after thousands of years. Concepts that bewilder Westerners at first often forever. There are attitudes of laissez-faire and nonchalance that turn to burning indignation if a toe-nail crosses an invisible line. Whenever I think I’ve seen it all something new happens. A few months back a man came round our village offering to buy the hair that had fallen from ladies’ heads. Cut hair wasn’t wanted only small balls of hair taken from combs and hairbrushes. That was a new one. A man comes and cuts the wild beehives that form in our trees. That’s his job it’s all he does. He assesses the hive and cuts one third of it then either we split the honey or we pay him for his services. He has no special suit or mask just covers his head with his gumca looking like a pirate from the Caribbean and climbs nimbly up the tree with the same agility as the man who comes and cuts the coconuts from our trees. When each of my four children was born the hezras came and danced with the baby on a khulo (a bamboo tray for cleaning rice and dhal). I wasn’t keen at first but the language they used was so unbefitting someone dressed in a sari with choli hanging limply lips caked with garish lipstick that I relented and after they had done their thing and assured my baby’s good fortune I paid them. I don’t know how they knew each time as they don’t live nearby. Some grapevine somewhere. This is starting to ramble so let me try and be specific. All these things I am sure can be found in other countries along with nuclear weapons and satellites orbiting Mars but where do they all exist in the same country? There is no stereotyped ‘Indian’. For every similarity there is a significant difference. Let me insert a quote from Mark Twain back in the 19th century.""…. The land of dreams and romance of fabulous wealth and fabulous poverty of splendour and rags of palaces and hovels of famine and pestilence of genii and giants and Aladdin lamps of tigers and elephants the cobra and the jungle the country of hundred nations and a hundred tongues of a thousand religions and two million gods cradle of the human race birthplace of human speech mother of history grandmother of legend great-grandmother of traditions whose yesterday’s bear date with the modering antiquities for the rest of nations-the one sole country under the sun that is endowed with an imperishable interest for alien prince and alien peasant for lettered and ignorant wise and fool rich and poor bonded and free the one land that all men desire to see and having seen once by even a glimpse would not give that glimpse for the shows of all the rest of the world combined.”India is blessed. She has been trampled on by foreign invaders for centuries but like a mountain lashed in a storm she has withstood it all. The ancient Vedic culture permeates India till today a bit tarnished by time and rusty from lack of use but still unifying the amazing diversity and absorbing the differing cultures and beliefs. I can live simply and try to raise my thoughts to the Supreme. It’s everything I ever wanted. That’s why I do it in India. There is no doubt in my mind that the future belongs to India and I am happy and proud to be here.",Murari Das,https://www.quora.com/profile/Murari-Das-1

There is no self-proclaimed Prophet sent from God no single Rule Book. It is a Philosophy and knowledge written in the form of Shastras Puaranas and Vedas. For Example: In the Science Museum at Kurukshetra Bharat/India (One of the Holy places for Hindus) there is a display which shows that In ancient times we used to believe that the Solar eclipse occurs when Rahu (The Demon) eats the Sun. The very next display portraits the scientific astrological diagram of the Sun Earth and Moon explaining the real cause of the solar eclipse.This information challenges our elders’ knowledge about solar eclipse but we don't feel offended because we know and understand that our elders didn't have this information. But if you dare challenging the same to especial religions most of them outrightly denies this even today when cars are driving themselves (before women could in some very special nations). And we know the fate of Galileo. If not please google “Why was Galileo was jailed"". Hinduism is an evolution of knowledge. Our Vedas & Puranas contain knowledge & spirituality not religion or rules. Veda is Sanskrit word which literal translates to knowledge. Which evolves with time. Scholars used to updates it with every new information. We Hindus still live in that frame and don't follow or agree which doesn't fit in current time or society. That's why Hindus are so flexible with new things and culture. This is why we always welcome new technologies and other religions oppose even loud speakers. It can't be compared with fantasy books. People have created the religion out of it to suit their agenda be it Indians or be it Abrahamic followers. The word “Hindu” was used as a geographical identification of “People who lived (still live) near Sindhu river (Hindu{Persian dialect})/ Indus (Indoi{Greek dialect}=India)”. We never gave ourselves a name outsiders gave us. Religions that were created among ourselves are Buddhism Jainism Sikhism all are having rule books and these religions are not praised by actual intellectuals because all of these religions (including others) defies the Vedas (knowledge) and proceed towards pretentious behavior and false pride. Some fraudsters became so lame that they chant some mantras or abra ka dabra to make someone’s fate good or bad/to flee ghost for money or fame. One infamous myth about Hinduism is that it had caste system. It doesn't have a caste system but the class system. E.g. Brahman means who have knowledge of Brahm (Educated). Anyone can become Brahman or anyone can become Shudra (Uneducated) Kshatriya means fighters (Police Army etc.). Caste/class is not bound by birth but by work and profession. Today Govt. and Private jobs have the same class system known as Group A B C and D respectively. Again Hinduism is not a religion So there is nothing to convert to. If you really want to become a Hindu just read a lot and gain knowledge and contribute to society for the welfare of everyone. Whatever it may be science maths geography philosophy spirituality space computers or science. There is no foundation. Just evolve and dedicate your life to other living beings (if you want to). Comment Question(Collapsed Now): How would you scientifically explain Shiva Ganesha Krishna Saraswati Laxmi Durga Kali etc. ? Shiva A God of Destruction Kali Goddess of Death Krishna God but in Human form (To teach Dharma {not religion} to judge/choose what is right and what is wrong according to situations/time) Laxmi Goddess of Prosperity (You can’t offer pooja to Laxmi only you need the Lord Ganesha God of Wisdom along with her indicating that money/prosperity is useless without wisdom) Durga Goddess of War (willing to unleash her anger against wrong violence for liberation and destruction to empower creation{Copied form Wiki}). These are all the essence and characters we all have in our nature which we (our ancestors) explained to them in the form of god so our puny minds can understand them eagerly fast. None of the Hindu God commands you that how to worship them or worship them at all. We worship them because we respect whatever they are representing. We Hindus worship everything who gives/teaches us anything. We don’t worship only Cows(which is overrated) but Monkeys Rats Snakes Elephants Peacock Lions Tigers Nandi-The Bull Rain Sun Moon Universe Trees Sea Rivers light even death is celebrated when someone dies if he/she sees his/her fourth generation. We even worship TV computers cars motorcycles trucks planes before launching them for their parts and givings in our lives. My mother even worships a road (Choraha-4 way road) on various occasions And the list goes on. One finest example I can give is: There is a Shri Krishna Sangrahalya (Like Krishna Museum) very next to the science museum in Kurukshetra which I mentioned above. There are so many old statues and scriptures from ancient times in the Museum relating to Krishna but not one thing is there to tell you how/when/if to worship Lord Shri Krishna. In short we respect him for his teachings not because we fear him. Example 2: There are many temples of different Gods in Bharat but you can also find temples of movie/film stars e.g. Amitabh Bachchan Rajnikanth. People worship them because these actors have given tremendous performances in the movies (in Positive roles) and have become an idol for their worshippers. Example 3: Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam A Muslim has made its place in Hindu temple beside Gods by dedicating his life for Bharat. We worship him. I’m going to share something which I copied a long time ago from Quora. It’ll further broaden your knowledge about Hinduism. I hope the original answerer won’t mind because I’m spreading his thoughts/teachings. All thanks to him.

Once Mata Anjani was out somewhere else and Pawanputr was feeling hungry. He saw a bright fruit in between leaves of a mango tree. He felt even more hungry as he knew the more ripe mango is the more sweet it is. He went up to the tree but saw the mango was far away but he want it and he flew 149.6 million km to eat up the bright fruit. Why? Because he was a child but still an ansh of Mahadev. As he grew up he recognized himself and his powers. Same is the case here. As a child Krishna use to eat soil like any other ordinary child. Mata Yashoda has restricted him several times as he was quite more than a toddler. Sometime she even use to punish him for eating soil. One day when she spotted him eating soil. Krishna in hurry closed his mouth. Mata Yashoda came and asked him to open his mouth in aggressive tone here any other child would have feared his mother even more as it's a normal tendency of an Indian mother to give a slap followed by that aggression. Krishna as a child too feared that. And when he was compelled to open his mouth he showed her the entire universe in it. Yes to escape from the punishment. Yashodha Maiya fell unconscious after that and when woke up forgot the incident. Thereafter Krishna never ate soil as he focused his attention on Maakhann (butter). :D PS : Don't try to find dense logic in deeds of a child. ☺,Akshay Kashyap,https://www.quora.com/profile/Akshay-Kashyap-68

Indra Agni Yama Nairriti Varuna Vayu Kubera and Isana are the eight guardian deities of the directions - at every Satya Narayana Puja we invoke them and make offerings to them. Also in all temple festivals and at the time of Vastu Shanti they are also invoked and worshiped. Pushan Mitra Usha Aryaman and Aruna as well as the Ashvins are associated with the Sun - Surya - who is also worshiped on Sankranti Days (when the sun transits to a sign of the Zodiac.) And very much worshiped during the popular Navagraha Shanti ceremony. Varuna is the presiding deity of water and is invoked and worshiped at every purification ceremony and before every sacrament. Rudra is Lord Shiva who is one of the most popular forms of God worshiped and has specific yajñas performed in his honour. Arayaman is the personification of ‘chivalry’ and is worshiped at every single Hindu marriage when puffed rice is offered to him by the bride.

Durga is serene blissful and benign mother of her children. It is form which people look upon as their own mother and worship devotionally. Kali on the other hand is mad with rage inebriated and roams about stark naked in the netherworld. She destroys the demons and prevents them from destroying the humankind. In earlier days people were afraid of this frightening demon-like goddess. However with the coming of men like Ramprasad and Sri Ramakrishna the worship of Kali was popularised. Now under their influence many people worship her also as the benign mother. Thanks!,Mousumi Mishra,https://www.quora.com/profile/Mousumi-Mishra-15

Yesterday night I had plans to visit a nearby Mahadev temple who were performing Rudrabhishek today morning at 5 am. So I thought it would be great to join and so i set my alarm for 4 am slept in time to wake up. 2 am I wake up coughing fiercely since I was having throat infection with dry cough for last 5 days.But till yesterday it was under control and i was taking proper medications. Till 3 am I kept coughing severely and nothing seemed to work. Literally had tears in my eyes due to excessive dry coughing. Somehow it got controlled and I slept around 3.15 am. I set the alarm off since i was in no state to get up at 4 and go to the temple. Anyhow I missed the rudrabhishek and was slightly sad. Woke up around 8 did pooja at home. And then I get an inner voice to perform a nirjal vrat.I eat or take water after my pooja only so I knew i could fast if I want to. Considering my dry cough episode fasting without water and medicines was like impossible since it would create heavy dryness and would result into breaking the fast. Anyhow I decide to go for itleft it on Mahadev. If he has given me this thought he would give me strength to complete the fast as well. It's only a miracle that i could observe the fast today. I have complete sore and dry throat without watermedicines and cough syrup it was impossible to live for 30 mins. And Mahadev gave me this strength to observe the fast without any difficulty.

Therefore Idols served as the vehicle or channel for devotees visiting the temple and was not just a mere piece of art. In the Shilpa shastras details such as the length and circumference of fingers length of nails length of nose etc. are dealt with in detail. Guidelines concerning the eyes lips hand positions clothes ornaments are also given. No two images are the same. Body anatomy stances vehicles headgear etc. are all different. Why the difference ? Various materials can be used to make the Idol. The location of the shrine climate and uses are all taken into consideration when deciding the material. The details mentioned in scriptures also taken into account.Difference based on material : In the ancient Vedic text Bhavisyapurana seven main types of materials from which Idols can be used are mentioned: stone metals such as gold silver and copper; wood earth or clay sand paint and gems.Clay Idols : In ancient India clay Idols had been popular especially so in north India. This is explained by the easily available clays and muds deposited by the north's many rivers. In addition clay is easily worked upon by even the lesser talented of Idol makers.Wooden Idols :Wooden Idols are carved. However due to their fragile nature they are not very popular. The Jagannath mandir in Jagannathpuri to this day replaces its wooden images of Krishna Balarama and Subhadra every 12 or 19 years.Bronze Idols :From the late 9th century to the late 13th century the Chola dynasty ruled much of south India. Chola art is best-known for its temple bronze sculpture of Hindu gods and goddesses many of which were designed to be carried in local processions during temple festivals.Marble Idols : Most of the temples in North India have lot of carved marble idols including Buddhist and Jain temples. The marble derived from limestone were available in great quantity in Rajasthan. The ability of marble allowing light to pass diffusely gives a realistic appearance to the idols. Also marbles are weather resistant.In Southern India the material used predominantly for idols is black stone while material in North India is white marble due to the availability of the material. Difference based on appearance : The gods and goddess were seen in two forms :Raudra or Ugra - are images that were meant to terrify induce fear. These typically have wide circular eyes carry weapons have skulls and bones as adornment. These idols were worshipped by soldiers before going to war or by people in times of distress or errors. North India have many temples of deties like Shiva Durga Kali.Shanta and Saumya - are images that were pacific peaceful and expressive of love compassion kindness and other virtues in Hindu pantheon. These images would carry symbolic icons of peace knowledge music wealth flowers. South India temple gods like Guruvayoor krishna Tirupati Balaji.Certainly not all idols depict the same god nor does it depict every god in the same way. In fact the same deity can have more than one murti that reflects different aspects features and roles of it. For example the god Shiva is depicted in his daksinamurti form as a teacher in South India; but in North India he is standing as Pasupati protecting animals and humans. The different forms depict the religious beliefs and cultural history of the place. Despite the differences the idols served as a focus for worship a portal for the experience of god. The different forms looks of the idols helped the devotee to achieve a personal experience of their god.,Venkat,https://www.quora.com/profile/%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%9F-Venkat

He defeated meghnat on the very 1st day of the war ….meghnat's blow of mace hit with full strength did not affect him at all.The enraged Indrajit struck the valiant Angada (who can tear asunder the enemy forces) with a mace like Indra the Lord of celestials with his thunder-bolt.The swift monkey Angada was unaffected and struck his chariot having a variegated body of gold along with horses and the charioteer in the battle.

Seeing indrajeet defeated those monkeys along with Sugreeva and Vibhishana were delighted and praised Angada as an efficient warrior.Indrajit on the other hand then was driven to a very terrible rage as he was defeated in battle by Angada the son of Vali a dreadful monkey.That Indrajit the son of Ravana the sinful demon who had gone out of sight and was cruel in battle rendered himself as invisible again and hurled forth sharp arrows bright as lightning. Source: valmiki RAMAYANA YUDDH KANDA SARGA 44Even in the final battle against Lakshman ji he was dominated by him. His chariot was destroyed  and he had again saved his life by fleeing from the battlefield and had brought a new chariot. Still he was dominated. Lakshman ji had broken two of his bows and he was finally killed by Lakshman ji. meghnat could not break even string of LAXMANJI'S bowHe could not counter even aindtastra of BHAGWAN SHRI RAMJI despite having its knowledge …Shakrajit’s weapons may be impossible to countenance in a battle—they are Brahma Aindra Roudra Vayavya and Varuna weaponsHe fled away in lanka scared from BHAGWAN SHRIRAMJI twice whenever LORD decided to kill him.Any normal vanar from BHAGWAN SHRI RAMJI'S army could effortlessly kill him in a PHYSICAL FIGHT …….JAMBVANJI defeated meghnat in SHRI RAMCHARITMANAS by kicking and whirling him and throwing him inside lanka. JAMBVANJI also defeated ravan in SHRI RAMCHARITMANAS and ANAND RAMAYANA by kicking ravan and making him severely unconscious. Angad too defeated ravan in ANAND RAMAYANA by binding ravan with his tail and slapped ravan many times and made him unconscious in front of his army .He had obtained a boon from Lord Mahadeva that his Tamsi Maya will be infallible and this was the only reason why Bhagwan Sri Ram and Lakshman ji had surrendered to his Nag Pasha astra.Their surrender to the Nag Pasha served dual purpose :Boons of Mahadeva were respected.They gave Pakshiraj Garuda ji who is a great devotee of Bhagwan Vishnu a chance to serve him.BHAGWAN SHRI RAMJI SHRI LAKSHMANJI SHRI HANUMANJI themselves respected his BRAHMASTRA…it is clearly written multiple times.1st proof""Honouring the spell sacred of Brahma the creator the two sons of the venerable Dasaratha have actually lost their free will and became dejected and have allowed themselves to be knocked down by the missiles of Indrajit.

Source: valmiki RAMAYANA YUDDH kanda sarga 74Hanuman ji had renedered all the weapons of Meghnad useless. Meghnad could capture him because he surrendered to the Brahmastra out of respect and he wanted to meet Ravana too. But the point to be noted is that the Brahmastra which is a highly destructive weapon could only bind Hanuman ji.Making the total target of Indrajit who was skilled in hitting his target useless Hanuma the great monkey swiftly wheeled about between the arrows.The aim of his arrows getting aborted and even his unfailing arrows falling down the high-minded Indrajit who was well-known for hitting his target got hold of a great thought.Keeping in view of that monkey being incapable of being slain Indrajit Ravana's son then formed an idea as to how to resort to capture of that Hanuma the chief of monkey-warriors.That warrior Indrajit excellent among the knowers of missiles and possessing a great splendor then fitted to his bow a missile presided over by Brahma the creator. Source : Valmiki Ramayana Sunder Kanda Sarga 48.He surrendered to the Brahmastra out of respect and he wanted to meet Ravana too and give the message of Bhagwan Sri Ram to him .Realizing that he had been bound by a missile presided over by Brahma the Lord of creation that Hanuma failing to keep his swiftness considered it to be a favour of Brahma the creator done to him.Knowing it to be a missile presided over by Brahma the creator and consecrated by spells sacred to Brahma the creator Hanuma then recollected a boon got by Lord Brahma the grand father of the entire creation.""I have no capacity to liberate from the bondage of the missile due to the power of Brahma the father of the world. Thus knowing the bondage through the missile presided over by Brahma the self-born creator imposed by the enemy it must be obeyed by me.""Thinking of the potency of the missile and the grace of Brahma the grandfather of the entire creation enjoyed by him and thinking about his capacity to liberate from it (which was going to alight on him after a while) that Hanuma obeyed the command of Brahma the grand father of the entire creation. ""Since I am being protected by Brahma Indra and the wind-god I do not have fear eventhough I am fastened by the missile.""""Even if I were captured by the demons a great advantage is foreseen. There will be a dialogue with Ravana. Therefore let the enemies capture me."" Source : Valmiki Ramayana Sunder Kanda Sarga 48.SHRI HANUMANJI told the same thing to nanguraj ravan""The sight of Ravana the King of demons is difficult to be obtained. Intent on that object (of sight of Ravana) the garden was destroyed by me.""""I am incapable of being bound by missiles and nooses even by celestials and demons..""With a desire to meet you I surrendered to the missile.

Source: valmiki RAMAYANA SUNDARKANDA sargaEven in valmiki RAMYANA DEVARISHI NARADJI HIMSELF said in the very 1st chapter of RAMAYANA that HANUMANJI was alone enough to kill all demons of lanka including ravan and that No celestial weapon can bind him""Though the release from the any celestial weapon's captivity is known to him  and though he is valiant enough to pulverise all the demons with Ravan but to see and talk to Ravana thus to gauge the strength of enemy Hanuma is intentionally tolerant of the demons and their making monkey of him when they fastened him with ropes and Source: valmiki RAMAYANA baal kanda sarga 1Conclusion : meghnat can't defeat HANUMANJI even if he done his NIKUMBALA sacrifice…but HANUMANJI will again disrupt its his sacrifice out of respect of LORD MAHESWARA'S and LORD BRAHMA boonLakshman ji could have single-handedly wiped out the entire Lanka including ravan along with Meghnad with his Brahamastra but Bhagwan Sri Ram asked him not to do so. As he did’nt want to kill harmless demons for the sake of only Meghnad.Then Lakshmana for his part was enraged and told his brother that he would employ the missile presided over by Brahma for the purpose of killing all the demons.Then Rama spoke to that Lakshmana who was endowed with auspicious bodily marks as follows: ""You ought not to kill all the demons on earth merely for the sake of a single demon.""""You ought not to kill on this earth one who is not fighting or one who is hiding or one who seeks refuge with joined palms or is fleeing or is intoxicated."" Source : Valmiki Ramayana Yuddh Kanda Sarga 80.Analysis :Bhagwan Sri Ram asks Lakshman ji not to kill all the demons for the sake of one demon ie . Meghnad.He asks him not to attack someone like Meghnad(hiding).His final battle with Lakshman ji was completely one -sided in favour of Lakshman ji. His chariot was destroyed  bows were broken and he was killed. He could’nt break a single bow of Lakshman ji.Meghnad’s chariot was destroyed and he fled from the battle.Indrajit the demon who was endowed with extraordinary energy standing on the ground his horses having been killed; was very much enraged and blazed with spirit.""You courageously fight so as to stupefy the monkeys. I on my part will return to the battle-field ascending another chariot.""""You act in such a way so that these evil-minded monkeys do not carry on their fight (with me) while enter the city.""Thus speaking Indrajit the annihilator of enemies having deceived the monkeys entered the City of Lanka for the sake of getting anther chariot.Arranging for embellishment of a chariot which was beautiful decked with gold furnished with darts swords and arrows yoked with excellent horses directed by a charioteer who could understand those horses properly and could give credible instructions to them that Indrajit a conqueror in battle who was endowed with extraordinary energy then ascended it. Source : Valmiki Ramayana Yuddha Kanda Sarga 90.Analysis :He was using a chariot while Lakshman ji was fighting on ground. Clearly shows who is better.Yet Lakshman ji destroyed his chariot and he fled to get a new one. He did’nt continue fighting on ground. Was he scared of fighting an equal battle with Lakshman ji?Lakshman ji tore his bows.Then blazing with hostile anger Lakshmana showing his agility of hand tore Indrajit's bow.Hurriedly he took another bow and made it ready. Lakshmana tore that bow too of Indrajit with three arrows.Thereupon Lakshmana struck that Indrajit whose bow was torn on his chest with five arrows which were deadly like a serpentine poison.Those arrows released from that great bow penetrating through Indrajit's body fell to the ground like huge red serpents.Ejecting blood from his month that Indrajit who had his bow torn took hold of his excellent bow with the bow-string firmly fastened and which was stronger than the earlier bow. Source : Valmiki Ramayana Yuddh Kanda Sarga 90.Analysis :Lakshman ji tore two of his bows while Meghnad could’nt break even a single bow of Lakshman ji.Lakshman ji finally killed Meghnad.""O my dear arrow! If Rama the son of Dasaratha has set his mind on virtue keeps up his promise and is second to none in his prowess destroy this Indrajit.""Thus saying and drawing up to the ear the arrow which went straight the heroic Lakshmana released it towards Indrajit.That large head of Indrajit separated from his trunk and moistened with blood was seen on the ground shining like gold.Having been killed that Indrajit then forthwith fell to the ground along with his armour and head-protector with his bow shattered. Source : Valmiki Ramayana Yuddh Kanda Sarga 90.Conclusion :Lakshman ji can defeat Meghnad in any form of warfare. But again he would do it after breaking the Nikumbhila sacrifice.. Meghnad had fled from the battlefield when Bhagwan Sri Ram had decided to kill him.""Scorched by my mystic missiles he will fall dead on the ground even if he enters the earth or into heaven or into the subterrranean world or penetrates the vault of heaven and remains completely hidden in this manner."" Source : Valmiki Ramayana Yuddh Kanda Sarga 80. Guessing the mind of that great-souled Rama Indrajit turning away from that battle entered the City Source : Valmiki Ramayana Yuddh Kanda Sarga 81.Analysis :If Meghnad was stronger  then why did he flee away from the battlefield? Meghnad was also using his chariot while Bhagwan Sri Ram and Lakshman ji were fighting on ground. This shows that Bhagwan Sri Ram and Lakshman ji were superior to Meghnad in warfare skills.Meghnad returns from Lanka thinking about the deaths of Atikaya Kumbhakarna etc but still he was not man enough to face them(Bhagwan Sri Ram and Lakshman ji) in a one-on-one battlePlacing an illusory image of Seetha on his chariot and a large army surrounding the chariot Indrajit intended to kill her. Source : Valmiki Ramayana Yuddha Kanda Sarga 81.Analysis :If Meghnad was stronger than why did he need to hide behind an large army and illusory image of MATA SHRI JANKI MAIYAJI. Conclusion : Bhagwan Sri Ram can easily defeat Meghnad in any forms of warfare and even if he performed the Nikumbhila sacrifice  still he can’t defeat BHAGWAN SHRIRAMJI LAKSHMANJI and HANUMANJI but again out of respect for the boon of Brahma Deva they would break the Nikumbhila Sacrifice before killing him.

It's very easy to please God Shiva  and he grants the desired boons to His devotees and at times invites trouble to himself. That is why Shiva is often referred as Bholenath the innocent God.There was an Asur named Vakrasur (Bhasmasur) he did years of penance to please Shiva and at last Shiva gives Darshan and tells him to ask for any desired boon. Then the asur says “ Hey Lord give me a boon such  my touch on any living being’s head should turn them into ash ! Shiva grants him the boon thus the Asur became Bhasmasura. But that asur out of arrogance tries to test the authenticity of the boon on Shiva! ( the place where the Bhasmasura incident happened is Yana Karnataka).Then Lord Vishnu had to come in the form of mohini and put an end to Bhasmasura. This doesn't mean that Shiva can't protect himself. This shows his love towards his devotees and He never punishes them. Shiva destroys the arrogance / desires / lust in his devotees and thus dissolves them into Him. If Bhasmasura would have touched Shiva's head that asur would have turned into ash since Shiva is Rudra ( fire )  and no one can destroy or harm Shiva.Shiva always gives another chance for His devotees to change for the better  and live according to Dharma because Shiva can't be far away from his devotees for a longer time !There are many such instances  which proves Shiva's innocence.An asur named Vidhyunmaali asks God Shiva to be his body guard. And Shiva accepts that too. Then Mata Sati comes and seeing her ferocious form Vidhyunmaali frees Shiva from his word.Gajasur  a great devotee of Shiva asks Shiva to reside in his stomach. Shiva doesn't say no even to this wish and resides in Gajasur’s stomach. When Parvathi requests Lord Vishnu to get her husband Shiva back  Vishnu approaches Gajasur and brings back Shiva.When Ravana asks Shiva  to accompany him to Lanka and stay with him forever in Lanka  then Shiva goes in the form of AATMA Linga with Ravana. Then Lord Ganesh goes and gets back Shiva.This all shows only one thing Shiva follows only one protocol whatever his devotees ask will be granted and He can never say No to them !,Sunitha Parapatla,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sunitha-Parapatla

O venerable one! Thousands of arrows were created from it and were seen to destroy men and elephants in every direction of the battle in addition to horses chariots and hundreds and thousands of weapons. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! When the soldiers were slaughtered the large number of samshaptakas and gopalas were overcome with great fear. There was no man there who could fight back against Arjuna. While those brave soldiers looked on that large army was slaughtered. Despite witnessing the slaughter and despite their valour they remained immobile. In the battle there Pandu’s son killed ten thousand warriors. Karna Parva: Chapter 1187(37)Agneyastra can be countered easily by Varunastra. A normal Agneyastra is not a very powerful weapon.To slay Yuyudhana he invoked a divine weapon. On seeing the extremely terrible agneya weapon the destroyer of enemies the great archer released the divine varuna weapon. On beholding that both of them had resorted to the use of divine weapons a great sound of lamentation arose. There were woes in the sky from the beings who had taken to the sky. However the varuna and agneya weapons were pacified when they confronted each other’s arrows. Drona Parva: Chapter 1050(73)In fact Arjuna countered Karna’s Agneyastra using just ordinary arrows.He was foremost among all the Bharata rathas and was the one who brought delight to all the Bharatas. He was supreme among those who knew about weapons and he invoked the agneya weapon. A mass of blazing arrows was released by the one who wielded a blazing bow. But Dhananjaya repulsed that mass of arrows with his net of arrows. Weapon was countered by weapon and these arrows preserved life. Drona Parva: Chapter 1008 (31)However the Agneyastra whichArjuna used to kill a million GandarvasAswathamma used to destroy 1 Akshouhini of Pandavas armyis probably a higher version of Agneyastra which Guru Drona got from Agnivesha.The powerful Bharadvaja supreme among those who know dharma taught the knowledge of the agneya weapon to the illustrious Agniveshya. O supreme among those of the Bharata lineage! The sage who was born from the fire334 gave knowledge of the great weapon agneya to Bharadvaja’s son.

He is somewhere depicted as old ox. Great Kalidas and Pushpadanta has termed Nandi as an old Ox. Here Old means matured or divine. खट्वाङ्गं परशुरजिनं भस्म फणिनः कपालं चेतीयत्तव वरद तन्त्रोपकरणम्‌। सुरास्तां तामृद्धिं दधति तु भवद्भूप्रणिहितां न हि स्वात्मारामं विषयमृगतृष्णा भ्रमयति॥ ८॥ O Giver of the Boons the old bull the parts of a cot chisel the elephant-skin Ashes the serpent the skull: these are the articles of your house-hold. And yet gods get all their riches merely by the movement of your eye-brows. Really false desires for worldly things do not deceive (mislead) one who is always is absorbed in his soul ( ie the Yogi- in fact You ). Nandi also represents the Jiva or the physical existence which is in the process of unification with the Shiva or infinite Soul or Ultimate bliss. So he is termed as Nandi or gladness or enlightened.

(Devas were only 33 while asuras were more than 1000) So the devas went to Lord Brahma and asked whether they can get into the battle. Lord Brahma answered yes and asked them to get Lord Surya Narayana’s (the Sun God) help. They approached Him with the word of Lord Brahma and He was wiling to support their side. The battle begun and they are fighting. Once in the middle of battle Lord Surya got tired and took a break asked Lord Brahma ‘when I get exhausted who will fight for the Devas?’ Lord Brahma answered ‘when you get exhausted those who do Sandhyavandhanam three times a day will be giving something as argyam with Savitha Gayathri mantra chant. It will give your energy back and you can continue your fight. And you can fight as long as there is energy.’ Lord Surya asked ‘So when will the battle gets over?’ Lord Brahma answered ‘the battle is never ending and it goes on forever’.” To this day it is believed the fight is going on. As Madhav Raju mentioned most mantras in Sandhyavandhanam are from Mahanaryana Upanishad (10 Kanto/Chapter of Taitriya Aranyakam) but that they are not mentioned with the word Sandhyavandhanam anywhere here. So yes Sandhyavandhanam is mentioned in Vedas and the purpose is also mentioned. And hence I disagree with S Sharma and agree with Madhav Raju.,Balaji Muralidaran,https://www.quora.com/profile/Balaji-Muralidaran

Lord Krishna is the incarnation of Narayan which is The Supreme Personality Parabrahma Parmatma. The One who is present in each and every living/non-living entity as a Soul an Aatma. Arjun is the incarnation of Nar which is a human like you and me. A human who can achieve greatest of victories and glories by having ultimate faith in Parmatma sitting inside him as a soul. Now let's see some events of Mahabharat:Arjun alone had to fight with deamons while burning Khandav Van to convert it into Indraprasth. Lord Krishna was alongside him at that battle but didn't fight for him.Arjun alone had to aim and shot the fish's eye to marry Draupadi in swayamvar. Lord Krishna was alongside him at that swayamvar but didn't shot an arrow for him.Arjun alone had to survive and struggle the 12 years of exile and 1 year of agyaatvaas. Lord Krishna was constantly by his side but didn't took the struggle and pain of him in those 13 years.Arjun alone had to fought the whole Mahabharat to regain his Indraprasth. Lord Krishna was alongside him throughout the battle but didn't touched a weapon during the entire Mahabharat.What's the lesson in this? “Even if you have Bhagwan (The Only One) by your side you have to perform your Karma your duities to make every single event happen. Bhagwan will not do the required Karma for that event to happen. You will have to do.” Arjun had to perform his Karma in every situation. Lord Krishna guided him in every step but it was Arjun who had to move his hands and feets in the end to make everything happen. Lord Krishna always guides you and me and everyone sitting as an Aatma inside us. Some call it intuition some call it inner voice. But eventually it's us who should become Arjun and must belive and have faith in that inner voice and perform our required efforts to make things happen.

It’s a common practice in Sri Lanka. I talked to many Buddhists there about various spiritual topics and they told me that it’s the norm for Sri Lankan Buddhists to visit Hindu temples even doing their main annual pilgrimages to a Hindu temple (Kataragama). I myself visited multiple joint Buddhist-Hindu temple complexes where visitors Buddhist and Hindu alike went from shrine to shrine praying or meditating at both the Buddhist and Hindu shrines. This is very much commonplace in Sri Lanka. It’s also common in Nepal where a large portion of the population identifies as both Hindu and Buddhist and consider them to be one religion not two. They visit each other’s temples without discrimination all the time. There are joint Hindu-Buddhist sites like this in India too from Gaya to Sarnath and other smaller ones in villages here and there. Many Buddhists live in countries where Hindu temples are rare so of course they don’t visit them.,Devala Rees,https://www.quora.com/profile/Devala-Rees

The temple is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas in the country and is also one of the most important sites of the Chota Char Dham Yatra undertaken by Hindus in India. The temple has to bear the onslaught of the recent floods in Uttarakhand. Although major parts of the temple complex had to bear severe damage the Kedarnath temple has remained unharmed. . That’s it people. I will add some more if I do find it to be placed here. Being spiritual is being eternal and experiencing the bliss of solitude and peace.

RelatedDo atheists secretly believe in God?,https://www.quora.com/Do-atheists-secretly-believe-in-God,,A contrary data point: a friend of mine ran a discussion group for atheists in Alabama. From time to time he'd get fundamentalist Christians trying to infiltrate the group hoping to hear something scandalous that they could use to discredit the group. After a while he discovered that a foolproof test to head off trouble was to ask new members why they became atheists. Real atheists would typically say unprompted something to the effect that the idea of a God just stopped making sense or started to seem like any old fairy tale. Interlopers would go on about how they were mad at God which of course is a common theist conceit about atheists that fairly openly disregards the usual definition as in bad faith.

Karma means actions and yoga means to connect. So karma-yoga is the process of connecting with God through your actions. Some people may want to connect with God in pure bhakti but they are too attached to their work and the fruits thereof - money power position or whatever. But they are also pious and have a desire to work for God so they give some results in the form of donations or time or expertise to God. In this way they transform their karma ie. their activities into karma-yoga - work that connects one with God. The element of connecting with God is always bhakti. Bhakti-yoga means to give all results of one’s work to God to perform all of one’s activities for the pleasure of God. Some people cannot do that so they perform some of their work for God and some for themselves and their families. In bhakti Krishna is the center of everything including oneself one’s family one’s society one’s work and so on. In karma oneself is the center and when one adds yoga to karma it becomes bhakti. Often Srila Prabhupada would not distinguish between karma-yoga and bhakti-yoga because both are work for Krishna. Prabhupada says:When you add this word yoga that means bhakti. Yoga means bhakti. Somebody is addicted to these material activities. So they are advised to act in the terms of karma-yoga. What is that karma-yoga? The karma-yoga is described in the Bhagavad-gita as yat karosi. ""Whatever you are doing kurusva tad mad-arpanam. You are working? All right. What you have earned?"" "" One thousand dollars."" ""Give Me."" Are you prepared? Krishna is asking kurusva tad mad-arpanam. So if anyone is agreed ""Yes Krishna here is the money for You"" then he's a karma-yogi. Otherwise he's a karmi. And the difference between karma-yogi and karmi means he has to suffer the result good or bad and karma-yogi has nothing to suffer because he's doing everything for Krishna. Just like Arjuna. In the beginning he considered that ""If I kill my kinsmen and my grandfather I'll be sinful."" Yes. But the same thing he acted under the direction of Krishna. Krishna wanted. So he's free. So karma-yogi means he is free from the reaction of activities. He is karma-yogi. Similarly jnana-yogi. Somebody is addicted to work very hard. Somebody is addicted to speculate philosophically. So for the speculator Krishna says bahunam janmanam ante jnanavan mam prapadyate [Bg. 7.19]. The persons who are addicted to speculative knowledge after many many births he comes to the understanding: vasudevah sarvam iti [Bg. 7.19] ""Vasudeva Krsna is everything."" That means termination of knowledge. That is jnana-yoga. If by his research work he tries to understand what is Krishna by philosophy or by science or anything by chemistry by physics... That is recommended in the Srimad-Bhagavatam: atah pumbhir dvija-srestha / varnasrama-vibhagasah svanusthitasya dharmasya / samsiddhir hari-tosanam [SB 1.2.13] Svanusthitasya dharmasya samsiddhir hari-tosanam. It doesn't matter in whatever activities you are engaged but if you want to know whether your engagement is leading to perfection then this is the test of perfection. What is that test of perfection? Samsiddhir hari-tosanam [SB 1.2.13]. Whether by your work the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied. Just like Arjuna did. Arjuna in the beginning he wanted to satisfy himself by not fighting and he fought to satisfy Krishna. That is perfection. Samsiddhir hari-tosanam [SB 1.2.13]. Yes. —Lecture on Bhagavad-gita 4.1 -- Montreal August 24 1968Krishna says:Only the ignorant speak of devotional service [karma-yoga] as being different from the analytical study of the material world [Sankhya]. Those who are actually learned say that he who applies himself well to one of these paths achieves the results of both. —Bg 5.4Srila Prabhupada explains:The aim of the analytical study of the material world is to find the soul of existence. The soul of the material world is Vishnu or the Supersoul. Devotional service to the Lord entails service to the Supersoul. One process is to find the root of the tree and the other is to water the root. The real student of Sankhya philosophy finds the root of the material world Vishnu and then in perfect knowledge engages himself in the service of the Lord. Therefore in essence there is no difference between the two because the aim of both is Vishnu. Those who do not know the ultimate end say that the purposes of Sankhya and karma-yoga are not the same but one who is learned knows the unifying aim in these different processes.",Jahnu Dasa,https://www.quora.com/profile/Jahnu-Dasa

(It deals with the medicines for various diseases)Before the start of any Yuga it is believed that Lord Brahma sleeps (the transition time taken from one Yuga to another) for sometime and that time the Knowledge or the Vedas leave Lord Brahma’s mind and spread in the atmosphere. Thus the Sacred vedas were in the form of Cosmic energy and were present in the atmosphere / sky / nature. And the great Sages / Rishis  connect to the cosmic energy and gave a written text format to the Vedas. In the Satya yuga there were only three Vedaa. In the end of Satya Yuga the 4th Veda was in the form of Cosmic energy in the atmosphere and an Asura out of His powers could read the Veda and thus got good virtue. That asura was born as Sage Atharva in his next birth  and because of his good virtue penned down the 4th Veda. Shiva felt that the first three Vedas cover Music yagna rituals and mantras to connect to God. But before that a human being needs good health to stay fit and to accomplish anything in his life. So knowing about the physical structure of the body and maintaining it from the risk of diseases is the prior importance. So God Shiva gave the authenticity to the Veda and named it after the sage as Atharva Veda.

The Vedas are considered to be divine in origin and not man-made. No one truly knows how old they are. Some of the Rigvedic verses were perhaps composed in the early phases of human civilization. For centuries they were passed down from one generation to another through oral tradition. They were probably rendered into written form during the epic period around 1500 BC. The Vedas are eternal (nitya) and out of this world (apauruseya). Hindus believe that God brings the Vedas into this world at the beginning of every cycle of creation for the welfare of the mankind and withdraws them again at the end of it. The Vedas are revealed to mankind through rishis (rsi) or great seers. The rsis were considered to be the mind-born children of Brahma who were created solely for the purpose of introducing the Vedas to the mankind. The word rsi means he who had seen (drs) the Truth. The Mystery of the Vedas : The Vedas are considered to be very holy Brahman Himself in the form of words and sounds. Beneath the layers of poetic imagery colorful visions and seemingly superstitious ritual prayers practices The Vedas said to contain profound secrets of the worlds their origins and knowledge of the spiritual realms into which man can ascend by the exercise of his will and transformation of his consciousness. They speak not just of various gods and divine powers of the external world for the purpose of bringing down rains drive away of the scourge or assuage our fear of storms and tempests but of various divinities and spiritual entities that exist in our psychic awareness and arise and awake as we progress through various stages of spiritual advancement in our quest for Self Realization. Although on the surface the Vedic hymns appear to be mere ritualistic invocations addressed to various gods and goddesses in reality they are addressed to acknowledge the arrival or descent of specific forces or energies of the higher worlds into our individual consciousness or to invoke their presence. Unfortunately we are no more conversant with the hidden meaning although we have some vague idea about it because of the revelations of Sri Aurobindo in his famous work the Secret of the Vedas.( To know more about Sri Aurobindo please to the section on Masters). For centuries the Vedas were kept as a closely guarded secret by the Brahmin Caste and taught only to a select few. (Something like the Microsoft not wanting to share its programming secrets with others!). While this might have enabled the Vedas to survive the ravages of time in their most unadulterated form and enabled the priestly order to maintain their sway it also contributed to the decline of the Vedic religion and the conversion of many lower caste people into other religions and sectarian movements. It was after the arrival of the Europeans to the Indian subcontinent that an organized and sincere effort was made to introduce the Vedas to the academic circles of the West in the form of translations and commentaries. The Vedas are four in number namely the Rigveda the Yajurveda the Samaveda and the Atharvaveda of which the Rigveda is the oldest and probably composed at a time when the Vedic Aryans were not yet fully settled and were wandering around either in the Indian subcontinent or elsewhere in search of a suitable homeland. The word 'Veda' means knowledge or wisdom and from the word Veda are derived the words vid (to know) vidya (study or education) vidvan (the scholar) and vedavid (the knower of the Vedas). (For more details about the four Vedas and their translations readers are requested to visit our section on the Vedas.) The Divisions of the Vedas: Each Veda is divided into four parts namely the Mantra Brahmana Aranyaka and Upanishad. The Mantra part contains mantras or hymns addressed to various gods and goddesses which are chanted during ritualistic prayers or invocations according to a particular rhythm. The Mantra part is concerned mostly with the pronunciation of the words and the vibrations they create in the minds of the invokers and in the physical atmosphere that surrounds them so as to render the descent of the divine forces easier and swifter. The Brahmana part contains information about rites and rituals and serves as a kind of guide book that explains the method and the manner in which the rituals are to be conducted. The Aranyakas or the forest books deal with the significance and philosophical background of various rituals. The fourth part of the Veda is called the Upanishad. The Upanishads are books of deep spiritual knowledge known as Vedanta. There are hundreds of Upanishads ascribed to the four Vedas of which 12 are considered to be the most important. (To know more about the Upanishads and the list of 108 principal Upanishads please visit our comprehensive section on the Upanishads.) The symbolism of the Vedas: The four parts of the Vedas have significance and relevance to the four stages (ashramas) of human life namely brahmacharya grihastashrama vanaprastha and sanyasashrama respectively. How this is so is explained below. 1. Brahmacharya : Brahmacharya is the phase of studentship. During this phase a student of the Vedas is expected to memorize the mantras completely and recite them with the utmost accuracy. At this stage in life for a man the mantra part of the Vedas is important. 2. Grihasthashrama: This is the stage of the householder. During this phase each adult is expected to lead a righteous life and live like Lord Vishnu on earth working for the preservation of his family and society through righteous deeds. For him at this stage knowledge of Brahmanas carry importance because they deal with the techniques of karmakanda. 3. Vanaprastha: This is the stage of forest-dwelling. During this phase a person leaves his house and properties to the care of his children and retires into the solitude of the forest with his wife to lead a spiritual life. The knowledge contained in the Aranyakas is useful to him during this phase.. (Interested readers may visit our sacred scriptures section and read the Aitareya Aranyaka available there under the heading the Upanishads.) 4. Sanyasashrama: This is the final stage of renunciation in the life of an individual during which he renounces the worldly life completely and spends the rest of his life in the contemplation of God and Self. During this stage the knowledge of the Upanishads is very useful to him. According to another classification the contents of the Vedas are divided into three parts instead of four. These are the first part known as karmakanda or the procedural part comprising of the Mantras and the Brahmanas the second part known as upsanakanda or the contemplative part consisting of the Aranyakas and the third part known as Jnanakanda or the knowledge part comprising of the Upanishads. The Smritis In contrast to the Shruti literature which contains revelations the Smriti literature is a product of human intellect. It contains the works of various individuals who base their information and interpretations upon the Vedas. Smriti means that which is based upon memory. It is the literature produced out of human intellect. It is sacred literature that is intellectual in origin and meant for the purpose of human welfare. Strictly speaking all scriptures which are not Shruti or divine in origin come under this classification. However the standard classification includes only those works that are based upon the knowledge contained in the Vedas. These are the law books known as dharma Shastras. They deal with various aspects of human life and social organization. They instruct how an individual should conduct himself or herself in society in the light of the caste to which the individual belongs. They define the rules and roles for various groups of individuals in society. The topics range from such issues as the status duties and responsibilities prescribed for the four main castes remedies against possible transgression of the prescribed laws and also remedies for divine retribution. Among the available dharmashastras four are considered to be very important: They are the works Manu Yagjnavalkya Sankha and Parasara. Of these the first one known as Manusmriti is the most popular. Known as Manavadharma shastra or the scripture of human laws Manusmriti was considered in ancient Hindu society as the ultimate guide book for human conduct and social and religious behavior. It provided guidelines for the Hindus to conduct themselves in line with their social order and religious duties. It is also said that these four works were supposed to provide guidance to people during the four great ages called the Mahayugas: the Manusmriti for the first great age called Satyug the Yagnavalkya-smriti for the second great age called Tretayug the Sankha-smriti for the third great epoch called Dvaparyug and the Parasara-smriti for the present and the last great epoch called Kaliyug. In recent times the Hindu law books have drawn widespread criticism from many quarters because of their preferential treatment of certain castes against the others and their narrow-minded and one-sided approach to such sensitive subjects as the status of women and the process of creation. (For a detailed study of the Manusmriti please go to our Sacred Scriptures section where you will find a complete translation of this exhaustive scripture) While we cannot deny the fact that the Law Books were particularly unkind and insensitive to the lower castes and women it is however important to remember that the dharma shastras do not enjoy the same status as the Vedas. They need not necessarily be accepted as the final authority on any issue unless your own sense of justice agrees with them. Unlike the Vedas they are neither eternal nor fallible since they are products of human intellect and social and political circumstances. They are not derived from the Divine directly. They are produced at a particular age according to the demands and general awareness of that age. Because of this they are prone to be defective and controversial even Therefore in the event of any doubt or dispute regarding any information contained in these scriptures one should check whether the information in line with the tenets of the Vedas and if it is not we can safely set it aside. The Vedas do not discriminate between men and women. Not do they suggest any caste discrimination. Out of the thousands of hymns contained in the Vedas a few are quoted as the basis for caste systems. These hymns are clever manipulations or inventions and should be discarded. The Itihasas: Itihas means history. Generally the Ramayana and the Mahabharata are included in this category. The Ramayana is the story of Rama and his battle against the evil forces unleashed by Ravana the arch-villain with a mixture of both good and bad qualities arising out of egoism who abducts Sita wife of Rama and faces the inevitable. In the end Rama kills Ravana and rescues his wife. The Mahabharata is the story of two brothers Pandu and Dhritarashtra their children namely Pandavas and the Kauravas and the recalcitrant attitude between them for political power which leads to a great war and mighty destruction of both families resulting in the victory of the righteous Pandavas. Lord Krishna gives his support to the Pandavas and helps them defeat and destroy the Kauravas and their great army. The Mahabharata is an epic of grand proportions rich in imagination and human wisdom. At its core are religion and family values. It is difficult to read the epic without realizing the destructive nature of man and the possible dangers for humanity because of that. The Mahabharata is the longest epic ever written in human history. It teaches us many moral and spiritual lessons and in terms of appeal has a greater appeal than even the Vedas. The Bhagavad Gita is the message of Sri Krishna not just to Arjuna on the battlefield but to the entire humanity who have to fight many battles both internally and externally while they live on earth. The book contains great spiritual truths that are relevant even today. It tells us how to conduct ourselves in this world with detachment and freedom of the mind. It speaks about offering the fruit of one's actions to God in order to become free from the cycle of births and deaths. (The complete translation of the Bhagavad Gita and the Ramayana are available from our Hinduism section.) The Puranas The Puranas describe the religious events that happened in the remote past sometimes starting with the story of creation itself. They basically deal with the incarnations of God and the deeds of God in various forms. In many ways they resemble the epics in describing evens. But there is one basic difference. The epics deal with the history of mankind and the events that happened on the earthly plane in the past while the Puranas deal with divine characters and events associated with them on different planes not just on earth. The emphasis in the Puranas is primarily on the divine. Through inspiring stories and amusing anecdotes and the use of story and drama they intend to turn our attention towards the divine and engage our minds in the contemplation of God. In a simple but very effective way they aim to strengthen our faith and lead us on the path of righteous living. The Puranas and the Itihasas are jointly referred to as the Panchama Veda or the fifth Veda. The Puranas have played a very significant role in the past in keeping the religious fervor of the people high. While books of great antiquity may not throw much light on the ancient history of Hinduism it is difficult to ignore their contribution to the gradual evolution of Hinduism into of the most popular religions of the world. Without them and the two great epics Hinduism would not have attained this status. What the Vedas could not accomplish with all their supposed wisdom and philosophy thanks to a self-absorbed and self-centered priesthood that rarely bothered itself with the initiation of the masses into religion or concerned itself with the spreading of religion the Puranas and the epics managed. They instilled faith in the masses and brought them into the fold of Hinduism. The number of Puranas vary. But generally 18 main (maha) Purunas and 18 secondary (upa) Puranas are accounted. The mahapuranas are Brahmapurana Padmapurana Vishnupurana Sivapurana Bhagavatapurana Naradapurana Markendeyapurana Agnipurana Bhavishyapurana Brahmavaivartapurana Lingapurana Varahapurana Skandapurana Vamanapurana Kurmapurana Matsyapurana Garudapurana and Brahmandapurana. Of these the most popular are the Bhagavatapurana the Sivapurana and Brahmapurana. The Agamas Sanskrit 'agama' means the acquisition of knowledge. In terms of religious significance the Agamas are as important as the Vedas. They are also not derived from the Vedas. The Agamas are manuals of divine worship. They deal with such topics as the codes of temple building image making and the modes of worship. Saivism Vaishnavism and Shaktism have their own respective Agamas. Saivism recognizes 28 principal Agamas and 150 sub agamas. Some of them date back to 2nd Century AD. Various schools of Saivism such as the Saiva Siddhantha school Tamil Saivism Kashmiri Saivism and Vira Saivism follow these texts and base their religious activity upon them. The most prominent agama text in Saivism is the Kamika. These texts consider Siva as the Supreme Ruler of the Universe the Highest Self the Conscious Principle while Shakti is regarded as the unconscious or the natural principle who is the cause of bondage. The union of Shakti with Siva at the highest level leads to the freedom of the soul (pasu) from the Pasa or the attachment. The Followers of Shaktism follow 27 Agamas also called Tantras. Shaktism considers the Mother Goddess as the Supreme Self and relegates Iswara the Divine Father to a secondary position. In Shaktism the Divine Mother is both the cause of delusion (Maya) and the source of liberation. Shaktism gave birth to the practice of Tantric forms of worship which were not generally acceptable to the followers of Vedic methods of worship. The Agamas of Shaktism deal with magical and occult knowledge besides mechanical ritualistic devotional and spiritual aspects of Tantric forms of worship The Vaishnava Agamas are grouped into four categories namely the Vaikhanasa Pancharatra Pratishthasara and Vijnanalalita. Of these the Vaishanavites consider the Pancharatra Agama as the most important (Swami Sivananda). These Agamas are believed to have been revealed by Narayana Himself. The Pancharatra Agama is again subdivided into seven sub agamas namely the Brahma Saiva Kaumara Vasishtha Kapila Gautamiya and the Naradiya. The Pancharatra Agamas consider Vishnu as the Supreme Lord of the Universe and devotion to Vishnu as the sure path to liberation. According to another opinion the Vaikhanasagama is the most ancient and most important Agama and all the Agamas practically and literally copied all their information from this sacred Agama. It is believed that the Vaikhanasa Agama was originally compiled under the guidance of sage Vaikhanasa during the early Vedic period. Sri Madhavacharya held Pancharatra texts in high esteem and equated them with the Vedas and the epics while Sri Shankaracharya had a different opinion. According to another classification the Agamas are five types namely: Sakta Agamas Soura Agamas Ganapatya Agamas Saiva Agamas and Vaikhanasa Agamas The Darsanas The Darsanas deal with the various schools of philosophical thought that prevailed in ancient India. Darsana means vision or perception. There are six darsanas grouped into three pairs based upon their approach to the concept of the existence or non-existence of Absolute God. These are : 1.Nyaya and the Vaisheshika 2.The Sankhya and the Yoga 3. The Mimansa and the Vedanta These six darsanas actually represent six different streams of philosophical thought that prevailed in ancient India. Each school had its own founder and a principal scripture as its original source. Thus the Nyaya Sutras were written by Gautama the Vaisheshika Sutras by Kanada the Sankhya Karika by Iswara Krishna the Yoga Sutras by Patanjali Mimamsa Sutras by Jaimini and Vedanta Sutras by Badarayana. In the course of time a great deal of literature gathered around these six schools of thought much of which was in the form of commentaries (bhashyas) of the original six works. Popular literature The Popular literature consists of the works produced in the vernacular languages other than Sanskrit such as Tamil Telugu Hindi Kannada Bengali and so on by eminent scholars over a period of more than three thousand years. Included in this category are both the translations from Sanskrit and also original works. Since it is not possible to deal with the entire list we are mentioning a few important works. Tamil is the oldest of the Dravidian languages and in terms of antiquity it may be as old as the Sanskrit itself. A lot of devotional literature was composed in Tamil by the Nayanars and Alvars in the early Christian era. The Sangam literature is a true reflection of the greatness of Tamil as an excellent medium of devotional literature. In Kannada another Dravidian language the Virasaiva movement led to the composition of Vachakam containing the sayings of Basava. In the north notable works in the vernacular languages included the Ramacharitmanas of Tulisdas and the Sursagar of Surdas both in Hindi Chatanyamrita of Sri Chaitanya and Mangal kavyas in Bengali the devotional compositions of Namdev in Marathi the poems of Mirabai in Gujrathi the Gitagovinda of Jaidev and so on. Both the epics the Ramayana and the Mahabharata were translated into many local languages. Other literature We may include in this categories specialized works such as commentaries (bhashyas) dictionaries (nighantuvus) poetic works (kavyas and prabandhas) moral litergies (niti satakas) Shastras plays etc. Modern Period: The period starting from the 17th Century to date also witnessed the birth a great deal of religious literature not only in Indian Languages but in foreign languages especially English. Worth mentioning here are the teachings of Sri Ramakrishna Swami Vivekananda Swami Dayananda Saraswathi the great mass of literature generated by Theosophical Society of India the works and teachings of Sri Aurobindo Swami Shraddananda Swami Sivananda the works of Sri Prabhupada Sri Acharya Rajneesh Sai Baba J.Krishnamurhty and so on.,Shayana Dev Roy,https://www.quora.com/profile/Shayana-Dev-Roy

Again the desire to get that position make you jealous of that person. The definition of greed already states:So to built desire means to be away from god realization! So Shree Krishna wants us not to even desire for the outcome of your work and be a ‘karma yogi’ by leaving it up to him! Why to be in headache thinking about the outcome rather than leaving it all upto himand letting him to take your responsibility? Here is the explanation given by Swami Mukundandanda in his book “Song of god”: Do your duty but do not concern yourself with the results. We have the right to do our duty but the results are not dependent only upon our efforts. A number of factors come into play in determining the results—our efforts destiny (our past karmas) the will of God the efforts of others the cumulative karmas of the people involved the place and situation (a matter of luck) etc. Now if we become anxious for results we will experience anxiety whenever they are not according to our expectations. So Shree Krishna advises Arjun to give up concern for the results and instead focus solely on doing a good job. The fact is that when we are unconcerned about the results we are able to focus entirely on our efforts and the result is even better than before.Consider its application to a simple everyday activity such as playing golf. When people play golf they are engrossed in the fruits—whether their score is under par over par etc. Now if they could merely focus on playing the shots to the best of their ability they would find it the most enjoyable game of golf they have ever played. Additionally with their complete focus on the shot being played their game would be raised to a higher level.The fruits of your actions are not for your enjoyment. To perform actions is an integral part of human nature. Having come into this world we all have various duties determined by our family situation social position occupation etc. While performing these actions we must remember that we are not the enjoyers of the results—the results are meant for the pleasure of God. The individual soul is a tiny part of God (verse 15.7) and hence our inherent nature is to serve him through all our actions.dāsa bhūtamidaṁ tasya jagatsthāvara jangamamśhrīmannārāyaṇa swāmī jagatānprabhurīśhwaraḥ (Padma Puran)[v40] “God is the Master of the entire creation; all moving and non-moving beings are his servants.”Material consciousness is characterized by the following manner of thoughts “I am the proprietor of all that I possess. It is all meant for my enjoyment. I have the right to enhance my possessions and maximize my enjoyment.” The reverse of this is Spiritual consciousness which is characterized by thoughts such as “God is the owner and enjoyer of this entire world. I am merely his selfless servant. I must use all that I have in the service of God.” Accordingly Shree Krishna instructs Arjun not to think of himself as the enjoyer of the fruits of his actions.Even while working give up the pride of doership. Shree Krishna wants Arjun to give up kartritwābhimān or the ego of being the doer. He instructs Arjun never to chase after preconceived motives attached to his actions nor consider himself as the cause of the results of his actions. However when we perform actions then why should we not consider ourselves as the doers of those actions? The reason is that our senses mind and intellect are inert; God energizes them with his power and puts them at our disposal. As a result only with the help of the power we receive from him are we able to work.For example the tongs in the kitchen are inactive by themselves but they get energized by someone’s hand and then they perform even difficult tasks such as lifting burning coal etc. Now if we say that the tongs are the doers of actions it will be inaccurate. If the hand did not energize them what would they be able to do? They would merely lie inert on the table. Similarly if God did not supply our body-mind-soul mechanism with the power to perform actions we could have done nothing. Thus we must give up the ego of doing remembering that God is the only source of the power by which we perform all our actions.All the above thoughts are very nicely summarized in the following popular Sanskrit verse:yatkṛitaṁ yatkariṣhyāmi tatsarvaṁ na mayā kṛitamtvayā kṛitaṁ tu phalabhuk tvameva madhusūdana [v41] “Whatever I have achieved and whatever I wish to achieve I am not the doer of these. O Madhusudan you are the real doer and you alone are the enjoyer of their results.”Do not be attached to inaction. Although the nature of the living being is to work often situations arise where work seems burdensome and confusing. In such cases instead of running away from it we must understand and implement the proper science of work as explained by Shree Krishna to Arjun. However it is highly inappropriate if we consider work as laborious and burdensome and resort to inaction. Becoming attached to inaction is never the solution and is clearly condemned by Shree Krishna. The equanimity that enables us to accept all circumstances with serenity is so praiseworthy that Shree Krishna calls it Yog or union with the Supreme. When we understand that the effort is in our hands not the results we then concern ourselves only with doing our duty. The results are for the pleasure of God and so we dedicate them to him. Now if the results are not to our expectations we calmly accept them as the will of God. In this way we are able to accept fame and infamy success and failure pleasure and pain as God’s will and when we learn to embrace both equally we develop the equanimity that Shree Krishna talks about. The verse is a very practical solution to the vicissitudes of life. If we are sailing in the ocean in a boat it is natural to expect the waves of the ocean to shake the boat. If we get disturbed each time a wave rocks the boat our miseries would be endless. And if we do not expect the waves to arise we would be expecting the ocean to become something other than its natural self. Waves are an inseparable phenomenon of the ocean. Similarly as we wade through the ocean of life it throws up all kinds of waves that are beyond our control. If we keep struggling to eliminate negative situations we will be unable to avoid unhappiness. But if we can learn to accept everything that comes our way without sacrificing our best efforts we will have surrendered to the will of God and that will be true Yog.JAI SHREE MADHUSUDAN🙏,Shree Keshava,https://www.quora.com/profile/Shree-Keshava

ONE ""Az-Zubair told me that he quarrelled with an Ansari man who had participated in (the battle of) Badr in front of Allah's Apostle about a water stream which both of them used for irrigation. Allah's Apostle said to Az-Zubair ""O Zubair! Irrigate (your garden) first and then let the water flow to your neighbor."" The Ansari became angry and said ""O Allah's Apostle! Is it because he is your cousin?"" On that the complexion of Allah's Apostle changed (because of anger) and said (to Az-Zubair) ""Irrigate (your garden) and then with-hold the water till it reaches the walls (surrounding the palms)."" So Allah's Apostle gave Az-Zubair his full right. Before that Allah's Apostle had given a generous judgment beneficial for Az-Zubair and the Ansari but when the Ansari irritated Allah's Apostle he gave Az-Zubair his full right according to the evident law. Az-Zubair said ""By Allah ! I think the following Verse was revealed concerning that case: ""But no by your Lord They can have No faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between them."" (4.65)"" Source - Sahih al-Bukhari (English translation) volume 3 book 49 number 871 TWO From Ibn Abbas who in turn reported Burayda as saying: ‘I was together with Ali in the invasion of Yemen wherein he once treated me harshly. So when I got back to the Messenger of Allah - peace and salutation of Allah be upon him - I mentioned 'Ali and diminished his personality. Accordingly I observed a change in the expression of the Messenger of Allah - peace and salutation of Allah be upon him - and he thus remarked: ‘O' Burayda! Have I not a greater claim [mastery] on the believers than they have on themselves? I responded: Yes indeed O Messenger of Allah. He then asserted: ‘Of whosoever I am the master (mawla) then Ali is his master (master).’ Source - Musnad Ahmad b.

Yes they believe that man is just another animal!They do not feel the need to explain the inequities of life by assuming an afterlife and a cycle of rebirths.  They accept that the world is not fair and the world need not be fair.  Yet they work hard to live the best possible lives and to enrich the world with their presence on the planet earth.They do not live their lives blaming fate or karma or the lines on their palms or foreheads for the poverty in their lives.  They find riches in their own deeds and the value they add to the lives of others.They believe that whatever has not been solved or explained by science today will be solved by science tomorrow.

Here are some of his greatness. Fast of all let me ask you what makes a god the most powerful? Is it the ability to rule over a population? Is it to kill thousands easily? Is it to do magical manifestations? Well no. Her I will tell why Vishnu and his avatars are the most powerful. 1 . Vishnu took the form of a small fish called Matshya and grew so large that he carried a boat full of people to protect them from a great flood.Here Vishnu showed that powerful is one who protects people. 2 . Vishnu once took the form of Varaha (half man half boar). He killed a demon and lift the mother earth on his task to bring her out of water.Here Vishnu showed that powerful is one who has strength. 3 . Vishnu once took the form of an women called Mohini to slay a group of demons. He seduce the demons to distract them while the other Gods can take away the immortality potent.Here Vishnu showed that power is feminine who if wish can control everything even demons and males. 4 . There was another demon who is near invincible. He has a boon that no human or animal can kill him no weapon can kill him. he cannot be killed in day or at night. He cannot be killed on earth or in sky. In order to kill this demon Vishnu tookj the form of Narasimha ( half human half lion). Vishnu smartly planned a way. He took the form of an human animal hybrid use his claws took in his lap and killed him during the evening. So non of the boons were useful to the demon.Vishnu showed that power is smartness. 5. Vishnu took another form called Parasurama. He is a mere teacher and a hunter. Still he has the power to invoke weapons like nuclear bombs. 6 . The famous avatar of Vishnu is that of Rama. He was a king but had to go through a journey of hardship. He and his wife was exiled to forest for 14 years. His wife got kidnapped by demon Ravana. Had to fight with many demons in the forest. Had to war with Ravana to rescue his wife. Leave and exile his wife due to pressure of society. Leave a life without marrying second one.Vishnu here showed that power is the ability to endure pain. 7 . Finally Vishnu took the form of Krishna a mere cowherd. He slay numerous demons lift a hill on his finger plays flute. But the most important part is his involvement in the Great Mahabharata War. He use all his magic illusion tricks techniques politics manipulation love to kill evil. But he never use weapons or injustice for it. Vishnu here showed that he is the start and end. He is all god all demons he is time he is space he is the one.Here Vishnu showed that power is the ability to fight for goodness. So it is seen that Vishnu is powerful because he is calm smart can endure pain can manipulate can teach can guide can destroy evil no lust for material needs can love.My name is Satyajit Kalita Ceo and founder of blogging and photo sharing site Zobez (http://www.zobetoynpuzzle.com/signup.php ).

On the bequest of the Supreme Court of India the seven member committee in the presence of the Head Trustee of Travencore Trust of Sri Anantha Padmanabha Swamy temple at Tiruvananthapur am in South Indian state of Keral have opened the six secret vaults. They have discovered under 20 feet of the ground approximately $22 billion worth of gold in the form of diamond jewellary golden utencils weapons goden idols golden elephents idols and diamond necklaces weighing 500 kilograms and 18 feet in length and bags full of golden coins of different nations including Napoleon and Italian coins. With this discovery Sri Anantha Padmanabha Swamy of Tiruvnanthapuram has emerged the richest God on the Earth. This chamber is being considered by the Trust members and other learned Astrologers of India as highly mysterious sacred and risky and dangerous to unveil it. Because the steel door of the Chamber-B is having two big 'Cobra (Naaga) Markngs' on it and the door has no fasteners or latches. It is believed that the secret chamber was sealed with the ‘Naga Bandham/Paasam' by the ‘Siddha Purushas' who lived during the reign of King Marthandavarma in the 16th Century AD. A door of such a secret vault can be opened by a highly erudite ‘Sadhus’ or ‘Mantrikas’ who are familiar with the knowledge of extricating ‘Naga Bandham/Paasam’ or by chanting a ‘Garuda Mantra'; except in this way the door can't be opened by any means by anyone so is the belief. At present it is impossible to find such powerful personality. If any human attempts made with man-made technology to open the mysterious Chamber-B other than by sacred means catastrophes are likely to occour in and around the Temple premisis or through out India. Even the Vedic Astrologers of India also expressed their inability to attempt opening by sacred means. If ‘Garuda Mantra’ is chanted by any powerful ‘Yogi’ it is understood that the door will automatically open with no human effort. Now officials have been warned not to open the last door.Picture: A secret door holding secret knowledge The team of astrologers which conducted a four-day ‘Devaprasnam' at Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple and concluded that the unopened underground vault at the temple was inextricably linked to the ‘chaithanyam' of the presiding deity consequently that vault should never be opened. The ‘Devaprasnam'— an astrological process that is believed to reveal the will of a god — revealed that the riches found in the temple's underground vaults belonged to the presiding deity. They should not be moved put on public display evaluated or photographed. Astrologers Narayana Ranga Bhatt and Padmanabha Sharma told journalists that the ‘prasnam' revealed that the idol of the deity of a temple which pre-dated the Padmanabhaswamy Temple had been installed inside vault B. This idol has not lost its ‘chaithanyam.' “The opening of this vault will incur the displeasure of the Lord ‘devan'. It would also bode ill for the people and for the land” Mr. Sharma explained. This vault was found to have an underground link with the sanctum sanctorum of the Temple. This vault cannot be considered just as a repository of riches. “If anything it is a safe house of the ‘sannidhyam' of the ‘devan'” he added. The recent opening of the other five vaults of the Temple — consequent to a directive of the Supreme Court — has also resulted in the displeasure of the ‘devan' the astrologers said. The ‘prasnam' revealed that people associated with the Temple — from those who do the rituals to the employees — were guilty of wrongful behaviour. The astrologers listed a series of penances to be done at the Temple. This includes readings of three Vedas one lakh ‘Thila Homams' 24000 ‘Maha Sudarsana Homams' 24000 ‘Laghu Sudarsana Homams' and ‘ Sukritha Homam.' The findings of the ‘Devaprasnam' come at a time when a five-member committee appointed by the Supreme Court to decide on the security inventory and preservation of the articles inside the underground vaults has begun its work. In India such stories never end I never heard anything more after Oct 2015.

He also defeated the people from Rome and the descendants of Khuru who were deceitful and wicked. He punished them severely and took their wealth. Salivahana thus established the boundaries dividing the separate countries of the Mlecchas (demoniac western people) and the Aryans. In this way Sindusthan came to be known as the greatest country. That personality appointed the abode of the Mlecchas beyond the Sindhu River and to the west.”Text 22Once upon a time the subduer of the Sakas went towards Himatunga and in the middle of the Huna country (Hunadesh – the area near Manasa Sarovara or Kailash mountain in Western Tibet) the powerful king saw an auspicious man who was living on a mountain.

The living entity is subject to good and bad contaminations. The mind should be purified by taking recourse of proper conduct and performance of japa. By chanting the holy names one attains the highest purity. (Jesus too prayed to his father: o holy father hallowed be thy name) Just as the immovable sun attracts from all directions the elements of all living beings the Lord of the solar region who is fixed and all-attractive attracts the hearts of all living creatures. Thus by following rules speaking truthful words by mental harmony and by meditation Oh descendant of Manu one should worship that immovable Lord Vishnu.”’Text 30“Having placed the eternally pure and auspicious form of the Supreme Lord Vishnu in my heart O protector of the earth planet I preached these principles through the Mlecchas’ own faith and thus my name became ‘isha-masiha’ (Jesus the Messiah).”Text 31“After hearing these words and paying obeisances to that person who is worshipped by the wicked the king humbly requested him to stay there in the dreadful land of Mlecchas.”Text 32“King Salivahara after leaving his kingdom performed an asvamedha yajna and after ruling for sixty years went to heaven.

According to the Puranas Sheshanaga is said to hold all the planets of the universe on his hoods and to constantly sing the glories of Shri Hari from all his mouths. It is said that when Adishesa uncoils time moves forward and creation takes place and when he coils back the universe ceases to exist. Lord Vishnu is often depicted as resting on Sheshanaga in the ocean of milk. Shesha is a devotee of Vishnu. He is also known as Adishesha (the foremost of snakes) and because he is Anantashesha or simply Ananta(endless as He is known to remain in existence even after the end of the Kalpa when the whole universe is destroyed). The serpent is the son of Rishi Kashyapa and his wife Kadru.Sheshanaga’s story is mentioned in the Astika Parva of the Mahabharata. Kadru gave birth to a thousand snakes of which Sheshanaga was the eldest. A lot of Shesha's brothers were cruel and were bent upon inflicting harm on others. They were even unkind to Lord Vishnu’s vehicle Garuda who was Kashyapa's son through Vinatha sister of Kadru. (Kadru and Vinatha were daughters of Daksha). So Sheshanaga disgusted by the cruel acts of his brothers left his family and took to austere penances. He lived on air and meditated in places like : Mount Gandhamadhana Badari Gokarna Pushkararanya and the slopes of the Himalayas.Souti said ‘The illustrious and greatly famous lord Shesha left Kadru and practised severe austerities. He lived on air and observed rigid vows. He went to Mount Gandhamadana and practised his austerities in Badari Gokarna Pushkararanya and the slopes of the Himalayas. He spent his time in these sacred tirthas always rigid in observing his vows and controlling his senses.Soon the Creator (Brahma) observed him in severe penances and told him that he is causing trouble to all the creation thorugh his terrible austerities. His penances were so severe that his flesh skin and muscles dried up and merged with his frame. Brahma then asked the naga the reason for his penance. Sheshanaga told him that he wanted to get separated from his brothers and kin forever since they all were evil and always hated each-other. He further stated that they even hated Vinata and her son Garuda. He also told the grandfather that he won’t stop his penances untill he has shed his body and would never return to his family.The grandfather saw him engaged in terrible austerities a lord with matted hair and dressed in bark his skin flesh and muscles dried up. Addressing the ascetic engaged in his austerities and truthful vows the grandfather said “O Shesha! What are you doing? Let the welfare of all beings also be in your thoughts. O unblemished one! You are causing pain to all beings through your severe austerities. O Shesha! Tell me what the wish in your heart is.” Shesha replied “My brothers who shared the same womb are wicked of mind. I do not wish to live with them. Please allow me this. Like great enemies they are always jealous of each other. I am therefore engaged in austerities. I do not wish to see them. O grandfather! They show no kindness for Vinata or her son though Vinata’s son is also our brother. They always show him hatred. So does he. Because of the boon granted by the great-souled Kashyapa our father he is much stronger. Therefore I shall carry on with these austerities until I have shed this body of mine. I will not associate with my brothers in this life or another.”Lord Brahma got convinced of his Shesha's will and asked the naga to request a boon. Sheshanaga asked that he be able to keep his mind under control and follow dharma so that he could continue to perform ascetic penances. Lord Brahma gladly accepted his request.‘When Shesha uttered these words Brahma said “O Shesha! I know what all your brothers do. There is a great danger that looms before them because of their mother’s offence. O snake! But earlier I have already provided for an exception. O Shesha! Do not grieve for any of your brothers. Choose whatever boon you wish for from me. I am extremely pleased with you and I wish to grant you a boon. O best of the snakes! It is good that your mind is fixed on dharma. Let your mind be established even more firmly on dharma.” Shesha replied “O divine grandfather! O lord! I ask for the boon that my mind always delight in dharma in tranquillity and in austerities.”Brahma then asked a favour of Sheshanaga. He asked the snake to stabilize he unstable earth. Sheshnaga accepted his request and asked him to place the earth over his hoods. Then Lord Brahma told him to go beneath the earth into the netherworld. Shesha agreed and went to the netherworld and stabilized her with his hood. He is known to support her even today thus making Patala his perennial residence.‘Brahma said “O Shesha! I am extremely pleased with your self-denial and desire for tranquillity. For the welfare of all creatures let the words that you have expressed be fulfilled at my command. O Shesha! This wide earth is very unstable with its mountains and forests towns habitations and oceans. Bear it up properly and well so that it is stable.” Shesha replied “O divine Prajapati! O granter of boons! O lord of the earth! O lord of every being! O lord of the universe! As you command I will hold the earth steady. Please place it on my head.” Brahma said “O best of the snakes! O Shesha! Go under the earth and she herself will open up a passage for you. By holding up the earth you will perform an act greatly valued by me.” Shesha agreed. The first among the snakes the first one to be born entered the passage in the earth and remained there. He carries the goddess earth encircled by a girdle of oceans on his head.‘Brahma said “O Shesha! You are the best of the snakes. You are the god of dharma because you singly hold up the earth encircling her with your endless coils. This is no less than what I myself or the cleaver of Bala can do.” Thus does the powerful snake Ananta always live under the ground holding up the earth on Lord Brahma’s command. Then the grandfather the illustrious lord who is the foremost among the gods provided Vinata’s son Garuda to Ananta as a helper.’ SOURCE :- Chapter 32 Section 5 Astika Parva Bibek Debroy’s translationAlso Lord Krishna mentions in verse 29 of chapter 10 of The Bhagvada Gita that “Among the many-hooded serpents I am Ananta”.Bg. 10.29 अनन्तश्चास्मि नागानां वरुणो यादसामहम् ।पितॄणामर्यमा चास्मि यम: संयमतामहम् ॥ २९ ॥ anantaś cāsmi nāgānāṁvaruṇo yādasām ahampitṝṇām aryamā cāsmiyamaḥ saṁyamatām aham Translation Of the many-hooded Nāgas I am Ananta and among the aquatics I am the demigod Varuṇa. Of departed ancestors I am Aryamā and among the dispensers of law I am Yama the lord of death. Purport Among the many-hooded Nāga serpents Ananta is the greatest as is the demigod Varuṇa among the aquatics. They both represent Kṛṣṇa. There is also a planet of Pitās ancestors presided over by Aryamā who represents Kṛṣṇa. There are many living entities who give punishment to the miscreants and among them Yama is the chief. Yama is situated in a planet near this earthly planet. After death those who are very sinful are taken there and Yama arranges different kinds of punishments for them.According to Srimad Bhagvatam Shesha is named ‘Lord Sankarsana’ (the Tamasic energy of Lord Hari Narayan himself) and is said to live deep within the inner layers of Patalaloka. Many other serpents are also present there with gems on their heads and Sankarsana is their ruler. He is said to exist even before the creation of the universe. When the universe is towards its end he creates the 11 Rudras to destroy the universe so that a new one can be created.At the time of devastation when Lord Anantadeva desires to destroy the entire creation He becomes slightly angry. Then from between His two eyebrows appears three-eyed Rudra carrying a trident. This Rudra who is known as Sāṅkarṣaṇa is the embodiment of the eleven Rudras or incarnations of Lord Śiva. He appears in order to devastate the entire creation.He is an expansion of Lord Vishnu himself which forms a coiled seat for Vishnu to rest on. Lord Vishnu rests on Sheshnaga because it symbolizes that one who has reached the Ultimate Enlightenment should be in peace and without tension or stress of mind knowing that Sheshnaga a snake is hovering above him.Approximately 240000 miles beneath the planet Pātāla lives another incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the expansion of Lord Viṣṇu known as Lord Ananta or Lord Saṅkarṣaṇa. He is always in the transcendental position but because He is worshiped by Lord Śiva the deity of tamo-guṇa or darkness He is sometimes called tāmasī. Lord Ananta is the predominating Deity of the material mode of ignorance as well as the false ego of all conditioned souls. When a conditioned living being thinks “I am the enjoyer and this world is meant to be enjoyed by me” this conception of life is dictated to him by Saṅkarṣaṇa. Thus the mundane conditioned soul thinks himself the Supreme Lord. This great universe situated on one of Lord Anantadeva’s thousands of hoods appears just like a white mustard seed. It is infinitesimal compared to the hood of Lord Ananta. Lord Saṅkarṣaṇa is the ocean of unlimited spiritual qualities and thus He is known as Anantadeva. He is nondifferent from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For the welfare of all living entities within this material world He resides in His abode restraining His anger and intolerance. Because the Lord is unlimited no one can estimate His power. This entire universe filled with its many great mountains rivers oceans trees and living entities is resting just like an atom on one of His many thousands of hoods. Is there anyone even with thousands of tongues who can describe His glories? There is no end to the great and glorious qualities of that powerful Lord Anantadeva. Indeed His prowess is unlimited. Though self-sufficient He Himself is the support of everything. He resides beneath the lower planetary systems and easily sustains the entire universe.Lord Ananta whose body is completely spiritual resides at the root of the planet Pātāla. He always lives in the core of Lord Śiva’s heart and He helps him destroy the universe. Ananta instructs Lord Śiva how to destroy the cosmos and thus He is sometimes called tāmasī or “one who is in the mode of darkness.” He is the original Deity of material consciousness and because He attracts all living entities He is sometimes known as Saṅkarṣaṇa. The entire material world is situated on the hoods of Lord Saṅkarṣaṇa. From His forehead He transmits to Lord Śiva the power to destroy this material world. Because Lord Saṅkarṣaṇa is an expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead many devotees offer Him prayers and in the planetary system of Pātāla all the suras asuras Gandharvas Vidyādharas and learned sages offer Him their respectful obeisances. The Lord talks with them in a sweet voice. His bodily construction is completely spiritual and very very beautiful. Anyone who hears about Him from a proper spiritual master becomes free from all material conceptions of life. The entire material energy is working according to the plans of Anantadeva. Therefore we should regard Him as the root cause of the material creation. There is no end to His strength and no one can fully describe Him even with countless mouths. Therefore He is called Ananta (unlimited). Being very merciful toward all living entities He has exhibited His spiritual body. SOURCE :- Chapter 25 Canto 5 Srimad BhagavatamAccording to the Brahmanda Purana Shesha resides at the extreme end of the netherworld (Patala-loka). The serpent is extremely powerful and has red eyes. He is immortal and wears blue robes. He is mighty and is huge in size. He is the king of all the nagas.46b-47. O leading Brāhmaṇas at the extreme end of Pātāla that extends to many Yojanas resides Sesa the noble-souled (king of serpents). His eyes are like the red lotus. He is devoid of death and old age. His body is as white as the inner part of well-washed Śaṅkha (conchshell). He wears blue clothes. He is very powerful.48-49. His physical body is huge. He is lustrous and mighty. He wears garlands of variegated colours. He has a thousand faces (hoods) with mouths shining and brilliant and resembling the golden-peaked (mountain) in purity (lustre). He has single kundala (ear-ring). He appears splendid with his thousand faces. He is refulgent due to a series of tongues emitting sparks of waving flames of fire.50-54. With his two thousand eyes that have the reddish splendour of the rising sun and with his body that is white and glossy he appears like the mountain Kailasa surrounded by clusters of flames. He has the white complexion like the Moon as well as the kunda flowers. Hence the cluster of his eyes shines like the cluster of midday suns on the peak of the white Mountain (Sveta Parvata).He has a huge terrible body. With it (resting) in his Teclining pose on his couch he appears like a thousand-peaked mountain of vast dimensions (resting) over the earth.This (enormously) huge lord of serpents himself of great splendour is being attended upon by extremely wise and noble-souled great serpents of huge physique. He is the king of all serpents. He is Ananta Śeṣa of excessive brilliance.55. That is the commandment (or act) of Visnu. That is the final established boundary (of the Nether-world). Thus the seven netherworlds that could be discussed have been recounted.SOURCE :- Chapter 20 Section 2 The Brahmanda PuranaThe same thing is mentioned in the Vishnu Purana.Below the seven Patalas is the form of Visnu proceeding from the quality of darkness which is called Śeṣa the excellencies of which neither Daityas nor Dānavas can fully enumerate. This being is called Ananta by the spirits of heaven and is worshipped by sages and by gods. He has a thousand heads which are embellished with the pure and visible mystic sign and the thousand jewels in his crests give light to all the regions. For the benefit of the world he: deprives the Asuras of their strength. He rolls his eyes fiercely as if intoxicated. He wears a single ear-ring a diadem and wreath upon each brow; and shines like the white mountains topped with flame. He is clothed in purple raiment and ornamented with a white necklace and looks like another Kailasa with the heavenly Ganga flowing down its precipices. In one hand he holds a plough and in the other a pestle; and he is attended by Varuni(the goddess of wine) who is his own embodied radiance. From his mouths at the end of the Kalpa proceeds the venomed fire that impersonated as Rudra who is one with Balarama devours the three worlds. Śeṣa bears the entire world like a diadem upon his head and he is the foundation on which the seven Pātālas rest. His power his glory his form his nature cannot be described cannot he comprehended by the gods themselves. Who shall recount his might who wears this whole earth like a garland of flowers tinged of a purple dye by the radiance of the jewels of his crests. When Ananta his eyes rolling with intoxication yawns then earth with all her woods and mountains and seas and rivers trembles. Gandharvas Apsaras Siddhas Kinnaras Uragas and Caranas are unequal to hymn his praises and therefore he is called the infinite (Ananta) the imperishable. The sandal paste that is ground by the wives of the snake-gods is scattered abroad by his breath and sheds perfume around the skies. The ancient sage Garga having propitiated Śeṣa acquired from him a knowledge of the principles of astronomical science of the planets and of the good and evil denoted by the aspects of the heavens. The earth sustained upon the head of this sovereign serpent supports in its turn the garland of the spheres along with their inhabitants men demons and gods.

Should they call an ambulance and get him admitted to hospital and get him treated ? Jokes apart I think he was only few of those unfortunate amongst the warriors who had to bleed to a slow death. It was a rather pathetic ending to an otherwise rich life befitting of a king in his own words. You may please observe that neither his father nor mother complained about his being left alone pathetically trying to ward off the vultures who were trying to eat his body parts. The highest Yudhistara thought wise was to prevent / chide Bhima from and for trampling on Duryodhana’s head with his feet. Even Duryodhana didn’t expect any treatment or extension of life beyond what was left of him. He himself said that he didn’t mind Bhima’s act of hitting his head with his foot as soon vultures will be resting on them. Treating him perhaps would deny him his entry in the heavens reserved for the dead warriors. Even Kripa Krita and Aswaddhama also didn’t offer any service or arranged for somebody to look after him but proceeded to fight on his behalf. The priorities were different then. Asking for or accepting help at that stage was perhaps demeaning for the warriors in those days. Anyway the visualisation of Duryodhana lying there with a broken thigh in a pool of blood thwarting the approaching jackals and vultures presents a very sad picture even for the worst detractors of Duryodhana.

A2A on this! Thanks a LOT! Let’s jump into this well-posed question straightaway and compare these two celebrated mythological creatures in Hinduism: ADI-SHESH or SHESHNAG (THE SERPENT IMAGERY IN RELIGIONS): In Hinduism Adi Shesha or Sheshnag is the primordial multi-headed king of serpents associated with the creation/destruction of the universe. The coiling of this great snake leads to creation as time moves forward; when it coils back the universe ceases to exist. In Sanskrit the word Shesh means “remainder”. The time between the destruction of a universe and the creation of a new universe is called Kalpa. Thus this serpent is all that remains when a universe ceases to exist! This great snake forms the resting bed for Mahavishnu the preserver God as he lies on the sea of universes or the Kshir Samudra. It is believed that new universes are created destroyed and merged infinitely like countless bubbles in this cosmic ocean! To elaborate this is how the serpent is described in Hindu religious texts:The serpent is entrusted with the responsibility of giving the gift of time to a baby universe as soon as it is created. Additionally the serpent was granted a boon by the Creator God Brahma to bear the weight of the Earth.Similar to this we have the Norse myth of Jörmungandr or the Midguard Serpent who bears the Earth and ensures stability by grasping its own tail. When the serpent releases its tail the Nordic equivalent destruction begins (Ragnarök). Adhi Shesh is therefore a symbolic manifestation of the perennial nature of time. The snake symbolises the tender equilibrium between the simultaneous creation and destruction of universes. GARUDA (THE ANTHROPOMORPHIC EAGLE): Garuda is a half-human half eagle divine creature (sometimes seen as a God) that is the mount or Vahana of Lord Vishnu. Legend has it that Garuda was so humongous a creature that when it flew it would block the Sun’s rays. Garuda who is the King of the Birds feasts exclusively on snakes and is therefore the sworn enemy of the serpents or the Nāgas.Legend has it that Garuda had six sons from whom the entire race of birds evolved. Various stories are there in Hindu mythology that celebrate the laurels of this majestic being the most famous of them being how Garuda brings amrita the elixir of immortality of the Gods from the Heavens to the Earth. The Garuda imagery commonly arises in Buddhist and other South-Asian cultures as well evolving out of Hinduism and expanding globally. Garuda is said to wear the great snake Adi-Shesha when he flies but this is NOT proof that Garuda is more powerful out of those two! Garuda wears the great snake as a promise he made to the serpents for which have a look at my answer to: If Garuda and Nagas are enemies why does he hold some of them like Vaasuki on his body? THE CONCLUSION: Garuda is credited with other heroic laurels but none for me even comes close remotely to the act of conserving creating and destroying universes and connecting these infinite universes as a single fabric of time a task the Gods entrusted to Adi-Shesha. I would hence go on to claim that the Great Snake (Adi-Shesha) is much more potent and powerful than the Great Eagle (Garuda)!!!Upvote if you liked my answer!

And this changes the color of the first phrase to:Though non-violence is the first preference violence that prevents a greater harm is the greater necessity.Modern law allows petty criminals to grow into full fledged criminals over time. Only then does the law even plan to catch up with them. But if you were to study criminal behaviour the evidence trail would more often than not lead back to childhood behaviour. Many of such “children” have been allowed to go scot free even for serious crimes like rape and murder because the law (at least until recently) protected all children under the age of 18 years no matter what crime they have committed. The new law merely brings the protected age limit to 16 years instead of trying them as adults for adult crimes like the ones mentioned. On the flipside while officials at the level of District Magistrates have judicial powers their primary function is revenue & administration program implementation and civil law matters of a “local nature”. But for criminal law and on serious crimes matters have to be heard at the level of district and sessions court and cases are known to drag on for years and even then the criminal can get away merely on a technicality. In the old system justice was swift and every public official (a dwija kshatriya) was trained in meting out instant justice if a crime was committed. Only when you can being people to justice within a reasonable time is justice really served. Justice delayed is justice denied!

This is often mistaken as the carnal desire of Brahma which is incorrect. As to why Brahma isn't worshiped there are 3 legends:Curse of Shiva: Brahma apparently had a 5th head which was extremely arrogant and often abused everybody in the vicinity. To put an end to this came Shiva and when the 5th head abused Shiva as well he cut off the 5th head with stuck on his hand. Shiva in turn was accused of Brahmahatya dosha(the killing of another person) and came down to earth to relieve himself of that curse. In Badri the lord himself appeared to Shiva and relieved him off the curse and even today in Badri there is a Brahma kapalam on account of where Brahma's 5th head was taken off Shiva's hand.Curse of Brigu Maharishi:Once when Brigu Maharishi was visiting the heavenly abodes and went to Kailasa where Shiva and Parvati were engrossed in their dance and did not pay attention to the rishi- he cursed Shiva to become a Linga. He then proceeded to Vaikunta where he stomped on the chest of Lord Srinivasa for ignoring him which is why Goddess Mahalakshmi felt insulted and left the heavenly abode. He then proceeded to Brahma where Brahma and Saraswathi were engrossed in the musical consort due to which he cursed Brahma that nobody will praise him or worship him in Bhooloka(earth) as he failed to worship and praise Brigu. But once Brahma pleaded mercy Brigu agreed to have Pushkar as the only place where Brahma will be worshiped.Curse of Saraswathi: Brahma actually had another wife by the name Bharathi. Why the need for this wife - I said to speak the vedas you need speech but first you need the intention to say them- that intention if your mind (manas) who is Bharathi. Once there was a fight between Bharathi and Saraswathi about who is greater. Bharathi says it is her because without the intention to say something one cannot speak. Saraswathi argues that it is her as even though one has intentions they are useless unless one can speak. To resolve this fight they end up in front of Brahma who ends up saying Bharathi is greater. So Saraswathi in a fit of rage curses Brahma that because he insulted speech henceforth nobody will praise him or worship him through words or speech anymore. If they want to praise him they will purely have to do it with their mind and heart. Even today before starting any of the Yagnas when one has to offer a praise to Lord Brahma they don't do it via shlokas but merely by heart.

One of the 12 holy Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva is in Jyotirlinga here in Somnath. The Somnath temple also called Somanātha temple or Deo Patan is a Hindu temple located in Prabhas Patan Veraval in Gujarat India. It is one of the most sacred pilgrimage sites for Hindus and is believed to be first among the twelve jyotirlinga shrines of Shiva. The temple was reconstructed several times in the past after repeated destruction by multiple Muslim invaders and rulers notably starting from an attack by Mahmud Ghazni in the 11th century. It is unclear when the first version of the Somnath temple was built with estimates varying between the early centuries of the 1st-millennium to about the 9th-century CE. The Somnath temple was actively studied by colonial era historians and archaeologists in the 19th- and early 20th-century when its ruins illustrated a historic Hindu temple in the process of being converted into an Islamic mosque. After India's independence those ruins were demolished and the present Somnath temple was reconstructed in the Māru-Gurjara style of Hindu temple architecture. The contemporary Somnath temple's reconstruction was started under the orders of the first Home Minister of India Vallabhbhai Patel and completed in May 1951 after his death.

Before you head towards the real abode of God understand the real story behind his presence. This will for sure take your soul closer to the Lord and help you attain eternal bliss. The wish of King Indradyumna The devotion of the great King made him feel the power which has no boundaries – the power of Lord Jagannath! King Indradyumna was a great devotee of Lord Vishnu and was eager to meet him face to face. Once a brahmana came to the palace of the King Indrayumna and told him about an incarnation of Lord Vishnu named Nila Madhava. The king then sent different brahmana’s out to search for Lord Nila Madhava. They all returned unsuccessful except a priest named Vidyapati. The discovery by Vidyapati After traveling for a while Vidyapati came to an area inhabited by non-Aryans called sabaras. He stayed at the house of a local chief called Visvavasu. When he arrived Visvavasu was not there but his daughter Lalita was. Vidyapati stayed there for some time and eventually married Lalita the daughter of the Sabara. Vidyapati noticed some peculiar behavior of his host. Visvavasu would go out every day around noon and would return back to the house scented with fragrances of sandalwood camphor and musk. Vidyapati asked his wife about this and she informed him that his father would go daily to worship Nila Madhava. Lalita had been told by her father not to tell anyone about Nila Madhava but she had overstepped that order by telling her husband. Vidyapati repeatedly requested to see Nila Madhava. The sight of Nila Madhava Finally Visvavasu bound Vidyapati’s eyes and took him to see Nila Madhava. Vidyapati secretly carried some mustard seeds in his cloth and he dropped them onto the path as he was walking. When he reached Nila Madhava the blindfold was removed and Vidyapati saw Nila Madhava. Visvavasu went out to collect some forest flowers to worship and Vidyapati stayed near the Deity. During this time a crow fell off the branch of a tree into a nearby lake and drowned. It immediately took a four armed Vaikuntha form and started back to the spiritual world. Vidyapati then climbed up onto the tree and was about to jump into the lake. A voice came from the sky and said: ""Since you have seen Nila Madhava you should inform King Indradyumna."" The hurting wish of Lord Vishnu Visvavasu returned and started his daily worship of Nila Madhava. Suddenly the Lord spoke to him and said ""I have accepted for many days the simple forest flowers and roots offered to me by you. Now I desire the royal worship offered to me in devotion by King Indradyumna."" Visvavasu felt cheated by his son-in-law; therefore he bound him up and kept in his house. After repeatedly being requested by his daughter he let him go. The brahmana then went to King Indradyumna and told him about his discovery. By following the mustard seeds which had grown into small plants they were able to follow the path to Nila Madhava. When they reached the spot they could not find him. King Indradyumna had the village besieged and arrested Visvavasu. Suddenly a voice came from the sky “Release this sabara. On top of Nila hill you should construct a temple. There I will manifest as Daru-brahman (the Absolute Truth manifested in a wooden form). You will not see me as Nila Madhava.",Pratik Awsarmol,https://www.quora.com/profile/Pratik-Awsarmol

Ghatotkacha grew up to be a talented warrior skilled in the usage of maya. However he grew upto be evil. He caused sufferings to Brahmanas as Krishna once mentioned.Nevertheless he fought on the side of the Pandavas in Kurukshetra. Ghatotkacha was a prominent warrior of the Pandav side. He had a whole rakshasa army with him. He was a maharathi. He fought against great warriors and defeated them. On 4th day he defeated countless warriors including Bhishma and Bhagadattta. He killed the prominent demon warriors from Kauravas. 4 of his rakshasa allies were killed by Duryodhana on 8th day. Ghatotkacha is very well known for his performance on 14th night.

This is an oldest and strongly dualism theoretical exposition of consciousness and matter. Samkhya School espouses dualism between consciousness and matter. It regards the universe as consisting of two realities: Purusha (Consciousness) and prakriti (matter). Samkhya philosophy includes a theory of gunas (qualities innate tendencies psyche). Guna it states are of three types: Sattva being good compassionate illuminating positive and constructive; Rajas guna is one of activity chaotic passion impulsive potentially good or bad; and Tamas being the quality of darkness ignorance destructive lethargic negative. Everything all life forms and human beings state Samkhya scholars have these three gunas but in different proportions. The interplay of these gunas defines the character of someone or something of nature and determines the progress of life. 2. Yoga this comprises the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. Many types of Yoga such as raja yoga jnana yoga karma yoga bhakti yoga tantra yoga mantra yoga laya yoga and hatha yoga and closely related to Samkhya school of thoughts emphasising meditation contemplation and liberation. The Yoga school builds on the Samkhya school theory that jnana (knowledge) is a sufficient means to moksha (Liberation to Universal Spirit) 3. Nyaya or logic which explores sources of knowledge using Nyaya Sutras. It holds that human suffering results from mistakes/defects produced by activity under wrong knowledge (notions and ignorance and Moksha (liberation) it states is gained through right knowledge. The six means of knowledge are: •Pratyaksha: Knowledge thru Perception •Anumana : Knowledge thru Inference •Upamana : Knowledge by Comparison •Sabda : Knowledge directly through Words •Arthapatti : Knowledge thru postulation •Anupalabhi : Knowledge based on absence 4. Vaiseika an empiricist school of atomism. It postulates that all objects in the physical universe are reducible to atoms and that one's experiences are derived from the interplay of substance (a function of atoms their number and their spatial arrangements) quality activity commonness particularity and inherence. Knowledge and liberation are achievable by complete understanding of the world of experience. This philosophy is credited to Kashyapa during Vedic times. 5. Mimamsa: Mimamsa deals with analysis of Vedic mantras. There are two branches of Mimamsa called Purva mimamsa and Uttara mimamsa. The Purva mimamsa analyses the Karma part of Vedas and the Uttara mimamsa for Jnana part. 6. Vedanta: Vedanta came to be the dominant current of Hinduism in the post-medieval period. Vedanta again has several divisions and primary is Advaita and Dvaita. Advaita literally means ""not two sole unity"". It is a sub-school of Vedanta and asserts spiritual and universal non-dualism. Its metaphysics is a form of absolute monism that is all ultimate reality is interconnected oneness.Dvaita Vedanta is a dualistic interpretation of the Vedas espouses dualism by theorizing the existence of two separate realities. What are Vedas and What does it Preach? Ancient Vedic philosophy basically comprises of Vedas Puranas and Upanishads. The Vedas are perhaps the oldest written text on our planet today. The Vedas are divided into four groups Rigveda Yajurveda Samaveda and Atharvaveda. 1. Rig Veda: Hymns in Prayer (Stotras) forms dedicated to Gods in tradition. It is a collection of 1028 Vedic Sanskrit hymns and 10600 verses in all organized into ten books (Sanskrit: mandalas). The hymns are dedicated to Rigvedic deities. The books were composed by sages and poets from different priestly groups over a period. About two-thirds of Rigveda is about the gods Agni (Fire) and Indra (Ruler of the gods). Rigveda contains a sense of intimate communion between Nature and the Rishis or visionaries 2. Sama Veda: The Sama-Veda is the “Veda of chants” or “Knowledge of melodies”. Hymns in Music& Melody form. A collection of hymns used by the priests during the Soma sacrifice. Many of these duplicate in part or in whole hymns from the Rig Veda 3. Yajur Veda is the Veda of ritual. The ritual is to recreate the universe within our own psyche and thereby unite the individual with the universal 4. Atharva Veda: Hymns which were focused on avoid calamities and sufferings. Vedas - Wikipedia The Puranas The Purana literature are in story form and voluminous in nature. There are 18 main puranas and most of the popular puranas were written by Vyasa. Puranas were the medium to teach the common man on values of life through an intelligent weaving of mythological stories. Some of the most popular puranas include Skanda purana Agni Purana Bhagavatha Purana  Vishnu Purana  Siva Purana and so on….. The Upanishads: The Upanishads are largely philosophical works in dialog form. They discuss question of nature philosophy and the fate of the soul and contain some mystic and spiritual interpretations of the Vedas. The compiler of the Vedas and Puranas was Vyasa and referred as Veda Vyasa. Vedic Tradition: Hinduism:The word ""Hindu"" came into existence because ancient Persians pronounced Sanskrit river name ""Sindhu"" as ""Hindu"" and Greeks pronounced ""Hindus"" as ""Indus"". Ancient Persians(Indo-Iranians) share common ancestry with the ancient Indians. Indu or Sindu or Hindu cannot be called as a religion it is just a way of life for Indians. Hindu does not claim any one prophet; it does not worship any one god; it does not subscribe to any one dogma; it does not believe in any one philosophic concept; it does not follow any one set of religious rites or performances and it may broadly be described as a way of life and nothing more.Difference Hindu Traditions Hinduism has different traditions as below. Goddess Durga is a central deity in Shaktism tradition of Hinduism where she is equated with the concept of ultimate reality called Brahman.One of the most important texts of Shaktism is Devi Mahatmya also known as Durgā Saptashatī which celebrates Durga as the Goddess declaring her as the Supreme Being and the creator of the universe. In Shaiva traditions Lord Shiva is central deity and in Vaishnava traditions Lord Vishnu is central deityHindu could:1. Follow any of the Hindu schools of philosophy such as Advaita (non-dualism) Vishishtadvaita (non-dualism of the qualified whole) Dvaita (dualism) Dvaitadvaita (dualism with non-dualism)2. Follow a tradition centred on any particular form of the Divine such as Shaivism Vaishnavism Shaktism3. Practice any one of the various forms of yoga systems in order to achieve moksha – that is freedom in current life (jivanmukti) or salvation in after-life (videhamukti)4. Practice bhakti or puja for spiritual reasons which may be directed to one's guru or to a divine image.A visible public form of this practice is worship before an idol or statue. Meaning of Hindus is Indians. British called this section of people as people of Hindu religion(who were basically non-Abrahamic) for administrative purpose. However Hindus/Indians actually refers to people of civilization originated from Indus Valley ( One of most ancient civilization of the world)India is a place where you will still find beautiful mixture of all major races of world as shown above who arrived here in times. This is one place in the world where you can locate almost all the oldest surviving ancient religion/cultures of the world living together peacefully. Hindu religious scriptures date back up to 6000 years and as a known fact India has never invaded any country in its past 10000 years of history and the people associated with ancient civilizations across the world who came here along with their cultural past due to persecution or ill-treatment in their native were adapted and protected here in this great land just because of ""Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam"" the entire world is a family is what our philosophy teaches if you are a Hindu. ""Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah"" may all living beings live happily in peace may good happen to all may all prosper and live their lives to their fullest potential is what Hindus still follow. Our great Sages were so tolerant that they supported reforms regularly with idea of inclusiveness of several cultures that came to India in times and at same time developed study of Vedic knowledge that are supported by science and truth. Spread of Hindu Culture in Indian sub-continent: This Hindu culture and school of thoughts (referred as Sanatana Dharma) at one point was all over India and South East Asia. You can still see the remains of this rich culture in the Hindu temples of Angkor Wat Bali and Thailand. Sages were main reason to spread this culture and wherever these sages have travelled the culture has spread. It starts from Agastya Adi Shankaracharya so on. Agastya - Wikipedia Adi Shankaracharya helped to unite various school of thoughts under one single foundation of Sanatana Dharma (currently referred as Hinduism). Adi Shankara traveled across the Indian Subcontinent to propagate his philosophy through discourses and debates with other thinkers. The united Indian culture what we see today was due to Adi Shankara’s contribution those days.Most people say that it was Adi Shankaracharya who brought major reforms in Hindu philosophy and also supported in abolishing animal sacrifices. A good example would be custom of offering coconut instead of animal sacrifices in Hindu temples. Adi Shankara - Wikipedia",Arvind Bhagwath,https://www.quora.com/profile/Arvind-Bhagwath

Just as the absence of the light suggests darkness and its converse of course the presence of light suggesting the absence of the dark so does the performance of ‘tapas’ reveal the self in the light of pure consciousness. Hence this methodology is the heart of all yoga and meditational practices. It is related to the concept in physics of Plenitude perfectly annunciated in the Supra Sutra viz. om purnam adha purnam idam. Everything is full in fact eventhough something ‘seems missing’ That which is so-called ‘missing’ is also part of that fullness which in fact is always a Gestallt’ an ever reversible mode of understanding Reality! Thus by engaging in ‘austerity’ the burning desire for kama retreats. Hence there is a balance between the socalled ‘seen’ and the so-called ‘unseen.’ Both are ‘see-able’ with the true eye of Knowledge.

RelatedWhom did Lord Shiva worship?,https://www.quora.com/Whom-did-Lord-Shiva-worship?no_redirect=1,,Oh this is a very beautiful question and the answer is even more beautiful! In Purāṇas we find a story where Lord Śiva was once asked the same question. This time however the curiosity rose in the mind of Mother Pārvatī and seeing Lord Śiva always engraved in meditation she wondered about the subject matter of his meditation. Once while walking in the jungles of Kailāśa Dhāma Mother Pārvatī throws a question full of curiosity. She saysLord Śiva I can see that while meditating you smile at times. Sometimes your body hair stand in ecstasy while you meditate. Sometimes tears flow like a river from your lotus like long eyes. At other times it would appear as if you are in some other world with only your body present at this place. What is the reason behind such symptoms? I have never seen someone like you who is so happy content and deeply engrossed in meditation. Kindly satiate my curiosity.Listening to the question Lord Śiva smiled. His smile was that of a small child carefree and full of purity. He said that what you’ve asked is something very close to my heart and indeed no one has ever known the answer to this question.O Pārvatī let me tell you about my source of happiness my greatest pleasure and my greatest secret. It is Rāmacandra who has stolen my heart and it is his beautiful līlās (pastimes) that make me go through so many emotions. In fact I who is regarded as greatest Yogī and Vairāgī is also deeply attached to Lord Rāma and this is actually the essence of all Vedic knowledge.He further clarifiedWhen I close my eyes and meditate I can see whole of Rāmāyaṇa with my own eyes. I can see how Lord Rāma at a tender age leaves his kingdom and kins in order to uphold the greatest principles and to teach morality to mortal humans. My eyes start to rain when I see him in grief as Rāvaṇa kidnaps Mother Sītā. I could feel his anxiety when he runs in jungle calling out ‘Sīte Sīte'. I could see that even though he is Lord of the universe but still he has hold himself in human form and is relishing the relationships with his devotees. I sometimes smile when I see that Lord Rāma orders the army of vānaras (apes) to build a floating bridge to Lankā. I sometimes get in ecstasy when I see the devotion of Sabarī towards Lord Rāma. All these pastimes and many others which are being played out by Lord in different universes constitute my life force and it would not be an exaggeration if I say that I cannot live without Rāma.Saying this Lord Śiva went silent. He went ecstatic as he was describing the leelas of Lord Rāma and couldn’t speak more. Mother Pārvatī too was in some other world listening to the līlās of Rāma from the mouth of a pure devotee. Thus we can see that Purāṇas tells us a big secret and we must understand the meaning of it. Just as Lord Rāma worships Lord Śiva similar is the case with Lord Śiva. Both are worshipable Lords themselves but while being same they are different simultaneously. Thanks for the question. Hare Kṛṣṇa!,Pranjul,https://www.quora.com/profile/Pranjul-15

This of course was never true according to the Vedas as the word “Arya” never meant a race of people and quite on the contrary was a designation which meant “Civilized Noble and Gentle”. In essence the word “Arya” was being used to describe those who had knowledge of the Vedas and followed their essential meanings. It can be stated that knowledge does not carry a label or race and all knowledge belongs to all of humanity. It cannot be that certain knowledge is only for one group and not another. But at the same time to intentionally translate the Vedas incorrectly to propagate geo-political gain is simply not an action of any merit. Thus India is in a more natural position to ascertain the actual philosophical meaning of the Vedic Age as this culture continues in India in large part. The fact nearly all Indian languages including Hindi contain vast amounts of Sanskrit vocabulary makes it easier for Indians to learn Sanskrit. Also the Brahman tradition of recital of the Vedas is still common place in India. The fact that the Vedas were recorded from Oral Tradition sometime before the founding of the Mauryan Dynasty is a very interesting occurrence. More research through out India in the future may reveal some variation of this tradition and we may discover some missing aspects we do not have today. It is of course very likely that this missing archive is rather small. However it is still worth searching for. The research in the Vedic field since Indian Independence has yielded many results. Some notable conclusions have been reached since 1947 and most paramount among them is the challenge to the Aryan Migration Theory. It has largely been shown that the Vedic people knew nothing of the geography of the world past Afghanistan and the Bay of Bengal. They were familiar with South India but only of the way to the South called the Dakshinapath. They did however understand the geography of North India in vast detail. The Vedic people also stated that they had lived in this region for “Hundreds” of generations. They were not invaders who had just arrived. They also described climatic changes which occurred long before the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization occurred. All of this has created a new understanding of Ancient Indian History and has shown that the Vedas are far more accurate than they had been given credit for. Future research should follow a path of enlightened fact based research. The meanings of Vedas are still being rediscovered in greater examination. The Vedas have proven themselves to be a binding factor for India and many of misconceptions of ages past have been corrected through their study. The Vedas are a national treasure for India and are also a collective historical cultural scientific and spiritual storehouse for all of humanity.,Baba Vickram Aditya Bedi,https://www.quora.com/profile/Baba-Vickram-Aditya-Bedi

This is relevant to the fundamental concept of dukkha ( suffering) in Buddhism. As everything in this world is temporary so is dukkha.

For one thing you need to define exactly what “God” is. And that definition is going to change from person to person. So for convenience sake we can split up claims about God into several categories.First you have the untestable claims. God caused the Big Bang. God guides Evolution. God takes the souls of true believers to Heaven. God descended to Earth in human form. These are all claims for which there is no evidence but also for which there is no evidence against. You can’t prove that Heaven exists but you can’t prove it doesn’t.Then you have the claims that are false. For instance “praying to God will heal you”. This is a claim that we have tested in a lab and we have found it to be false. The God that heals the sick who pray to him does not exist. Or “God strikes down nonbelievers”. This is also false.Finally there are the claims that go against our current understanding of the universe. God flooded the world. God died and rose from the dead. God will cause the stars to fall from the sky. These claims are untestable but they’re also considered impossible. If true these claims would upend our current understanding of science. You’ll notice that I haven’t mentioned any claims that have been proven by science. This is because to the best of my knowledge there are none.,Michael B.,https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-B-720

In the Mahabharata Krishna plays a central role along with others like Arjun Bhim Yudhishthir and so many others. In fact there are so many that a list of ‘major’ names can itself be a separate article. As anyone familiar with the epic might already know the Mahabharata revolves around the Pandavas and the Kauravas. The Pandavas were the five sons of Pandu namely Yudhishthir Bhim Arjun Nakul Sahadev. The Kauravas were descendants of the legendary king Kuru. They were many in number with the more famous ones being Duryodhana and Dushasana. In the epic’s central war or the Mahabharata Yudh many weapons have been used.

He is called as the 'King of Nagas'. He is a divine cosmic serpent. His power is literally beyond this Universe. There is no limit to his cosmic power. He possesses Infinite cosmic power. He is so powerful that he literally holds the entire cosmos on one of his hoods. The Universe is just a mustard seed in comparison to his physical form. Lord Anantha Shesha is endless. Even Lord Garuda who has enough power to bear the mass of three realms on one of his feathers couldn't find the end of his elder brother Adi Shesha. He is more than capable of bearing the mass of all the planets of the solar system on one of his hoods as well. First and foremost he is known to be the resting place of Maha Vishnu himself. If he is capable of holding a supreme being like Maha Vishnu then he is more than capable of bearing the mass of the entire Universe too. One important point to be taken into consideration is that Lord Adi Shesha is not just some devotee or servant of Maha Vishnu but he is an expansion of Maha Vishnu himself. Lord Adi Shesha is the partial manifestation of Maha Vishnu himself. Also Maha Vishnu and Lord Anantha Sheshanaag are inseparable. Maha Vishnu and Lord Anantha Sheshanaag are one and the same. So he is non-different from Maha Vishnu when it comes to pure spiritual energy. According to Hindu scriptures Lord Anantha Shesha is a time gap between the creation and destruction of the Universe. As long as Lord Anantha Shesha keeps on uncoiling time moves on forward and the creation takes place. If Lord Anantha Sheshanaag coils back the very next moment it will bring an end to the existence of this Universe. For instance even after the destruction of the entire Universe Lord Anantha Shesha will still remain intact without a scratch even after the entire creation is gone.

He had 'Ichhamrityu' so lived another six months on his bed of arrows waiting for 'Uttarayana'. Arjuna was battling and piercing Bhisma 'putting Sikhandin before him.' Sanjaya revealed - 'Hence all the Pandavas setting Sikhandin before them punctured Bhishma in that fight consistently encompassing him on all sides'. Once more we find in Dhritarashtra's mourn in the Adi Parva - 'When I heard that Arjuna having put Sikhandin before himself in his chariot had injured Bhishma of limitless boldness and powerful in fight at that point O Sanjaya I had no expectation of victories'. Does the expression 'putting Sikhandin before him' mean Arjuna utilized Shikhandi as a shield? Provided that this is true at that point how should all the Pandavas place a similar individual before them? For what reason would it be advisable for us to take the expression in a real sense for Arjuna's situation however rhetoricaly on account of the other Pandavas? In a front line was it truly workable for Arjuna to utilize Shikhandi as an individual shield? With Drona Kritavarman Jayadratha Bhurisravas Sala Salya and Bhagadatta all close by and assaulting Arjuna wouldn't it have been 'harikiri' of honor for Arjuna? Could Arjuna put his own notoriety and honor in question consequently? The portrayal of war shows Bhisma indicated no mercy to Arjuna that day. He was 'licking the edges of his mouth.' Arjuna and Bhisma were battling vis-à-vis. Arjuna continuously remove all the bows of Bhishma. From that point onward Bhishma 'not at this point wanted to fight with Arjuna'. Without a doubt the fight was with Arjuna. Bhisma tended to Duhshashana with a grin and stated 'these bolts flowing towards me in one nonstop line whose touch resembleth that of paradise's jolt have been shot by Arjuna'. Duhshashana was ensuring Bhisma that day. In the event that Arjuna had truly been doing any demonstration of weakness or out of line war Duhshashana would have remarked upon the issue at that very occasion. At the point when Bhisma 'tumbled down' from his chariot - 'There was not in Bhishma's body space of even two fingers' expansiveness that was not penetrated with bolts.' On the 10th day Krishna arranged a hard and fast assault on Bhisma under the Shikhandin Division which had for such a long time been putting away energy. That day Sikhandin Division drove the assault and Arjuna secured Sikhandi himself. That is the thing that the expression 'putting Sikhandin before him' really implies. In the last piece of that day's war Arjuna 'positioned at the top of his soldiers broke the focal point of the Kuru armed force'. Along these lines from the outset Shikhandi started to lead the pack yet later it was Arjuna. Under gigantic assault from Arjuna the Kaurava champions of various country 'deserted Bhishma'. Vyasa keeping in mind Bhisma didn't utilize the word 'passing' and left the issue questionable. Last artists taking this in a real sense introduced the narrative of Bhisma punctured with bolts everywhere on his body living for an additional a half year on the bed of bolts. There is no notice of Arjuna's 'dishonest' battle in Sanjaya's report that follows right away. He just referenced that Bhisma 'had gotten quiet'. At the point when Karna went to meet Bhisma that night neither he nor Bhisma made any references to Arjuna's 'fainthearted' demonstration. Bhisma lived for that evening as it were. His monstrous agony is obvious when he addressed Karna. His 'eyes were covered with film' and he could just 'gradually raise his eyelids.' He was unable to have lived for an additional a half year in that condition. Science won't allow that nor any sensible inspire bigger thoughts. Vyasa would never have made a particularly improper legend. The fourth Section of Bhisma Parva unmistakably makes reference to the way of Bhisma's passing. Sanjaya said to Dhritarashtra - 'Having beset the Pancalas and the Pandavas endued with incredible action and killed a huge number of champions he was finally killed by Arjuna.' from the start Arjuna just injured Bhisma (obvious in Dhritarashtra's grievance.). His adoration for his granddad didn't allow him (regardless of Krishna's talk on the job.) an out and out butcher. Arjuna would never do the dishonorable demonstration of executing Bhisma. Bhisma kicked the bucket that evening in the wake of giving Karna his due acknowledgment. There is no motivation to accept something else.,Netra Bajaj,https://www.quora.com/profile/Netra-Bajaj

That is why Shiva is often referred as Bholenath the innocent God.There was an Asur named Vakrasur (Bhasmasur) he did years of penance to please Shiva and at last Shiva gives Darshan and tells him to ask for any desired boon. Then the asur says “ Hey Lord give me a boon such  my touch on any living being’s head should turn them into ash ! Shiva grants him the boon thus the Asur became Bhasmasura. But that asur out of arrogance tries to test the authenticity of the boon on Shiva! ( the place where the Bhasmasura incident happened is Yana Karnataka).Then Lord Vishnu had to come in the form of mohini and put an end to Bhasmasura. This doesn't mean that Shiva can't protect himself. This shows his love towards his devotees and He never punishes them. Shiva destroys the arrogance / desires / lust in his devotees and thus dissolves them into Him. If Bhasmasura would have touched Shiva's head that asur would have turned into ash since Shiva is Rudra ( fire )  and no one can destroy or harm Shiva.Shiva always gives another chance for His devotees to change for the better  and live according to Dharma because Shiva can't be far away from his devotees for a longer time !There are many such instances  which proves Shiva's innocence.An asur named Vidhyunmaali asks God Shiva to be his body guard. And Shiva accepts that too. Then Mata Sati comes and seeing her ferocious form Vidhyunmaali frees Shiva from his word.Gajasur  a great devotee of Shiva asks Shiva to reside in his stomach. Shiva doesn't say no even to this wish and resides in Gajasur’s stomach. When Parvathi requests Lord Vishnu to get her husband Shiva back  Vishnu approaches Gajasur and brings back Shiva.When Ravana asks Shiva  to accompany him to Lanka and stay with him forever in Lanka  then Shiva goes in the form of AATMA Linga with Ravana. Then Lord Ganesh goes and gets back Shiva.This all shows only one thing Shiva follows only one protocol whatever his devotees ask will be granted and He can never say No to them !,Sunitha Parapatla,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sunitha-Parapatla

RelatedAre Sikh happy in India?,https://www.quora.com/Are-Sikh-happy-in-India,,Years ago a flock of sheep gathered on a Special day on the Request and Instruction of a Lion. He was great and Just. He fought for the Weak and helped the helpless even though he was a lion. He was soo devoted to making the world a better place that he showed the flock of sheep how to transform into a Lion. He asked for volunteers and made 5 sheep into Lions infront of the flock of sheep. Years passed by and those 5 lions became and 500 lions going to all corners of the country. More years slipped by and they became 500000 lions. They had to face many devils and foreign enemies but they did not give up. Like a lion they proved them selves the king of the Jungle and continued the path that had been started all those years ago. Equality and protection of the Weak. As more years came these lions started to go sleep. The Rage and spark of Justice was Lost. And then came a time when these Lions started to reduce in Numbers rather than increasing. These Lions were a Prestigious flock who somewhere have fallen silent. These Lions are called Sikhs. Are we Sikhs happy in India? I am. This is our Homeland. Our Guru's were born on this land our history was written on this land. Our 5 takhts are spread across India. There is no reason I or any other Sikh would have a problem with his own country. But is the condition of Sikhs Perfect in India not nearly. But that wouldn't make me unhappy with my Country. So what needs to be improved is the situation of Sikhs in India. All around the World other than India i see Sikhs doing soo much for the Religion which makes me wonder why can't we do the same in India.YouTube channelsOnline blogsFighting for Equal RightsGlobal RecognitionOnline Knowledge Websites and Apps.Why are soo many foreign living Sikhs contributing as compared to a very few number of Sikhs in India? There are a thousand more issues that can be approached in soo many ways. But the point ultimately remains the same. But we ourselves are to be blamed. I blame all Sikhs who aren't doing there part. Langar helping others fighting for others and equality have become terms only being used in discussion and not in real life. I used to think that Many Indians don't know about the Contributions of Sikhs for India and its people. But I was partially wrong. There are many who do know. But there are also many who are wrongly informed. I myself try to spread the right path of Sikhism as much as I can to as much people I can. Political Setbacks The Growth of Sikhism is partially to be blamed because of participation of Politics in Religion. Everyday newspapers are filled with political stories of Sikhs and Gurdwaras’. And none of this politics is concerned with the betterment of our Religion and Strengthening core values. It is also a shame that Canadian Parliament has more Sikhs than the Indian Parliament. Of course the Usual fight for Justice of 1984 riots still carries on till date. But it shouldn't hamper the protection of our culture and stop its growth. When it comes to Politics it doesn't limit itself to high level issues. There is a tendency today of communities to build as much Gurdwaras as possible. My sector alone has 3 Gurdwaras and another Gurdwara in a different sector a kilometer away hardly. I personally feel all that money could be used for increasing Sikh education and helping the society. India is perfect and Sikhs should be proud to be Indians. Of course there is some discrimination and issues that need to be tackled. But that is the responsibility of the youth to deal with. The Sikh Youth Needs to Rise from the Ashes and become Lions once again. Singh. If there is anything that happen which is against the Sikh ideology we must step forward and stop it.

Even when the idols have been burnt the “brahma” that makes the neem tree wood idols a living deity has always been saved by one means or the other.Invasion by “Raktabahu” (800 A.D.)The “Madalapanji” records this invasion by the Rashtrakuta empire king Govinda III alias Raktabahu as the first invasion of the Puri temple. He defeated the then king of Odisha Subhanadeva after reaching Puri through the sea route. In this meantime the King had fled Puri along with his associates and carrying the idols to his western frontier to Gopali village near current-day Sonepur of Odisha. He buried the idols there until it was revived 146 years later by Yayati I performed Nabakalebara and brought the Lord back to his home. The place where the three idols were buried is now referred to as “Patali Srikhetra” which is in the current-day Subarnapur district of Odisha. 2. Invasion by Illias Shahi (1340 A.D.) Illias Shahi was the sultan of Bengal who took advantage of the weak northern defense of the then king Narasimhadeva III and attacked Puri. Illias Shahi bribed the commanders at the Raibania fort and was successful in reaching Puri. The King couldn’t defend his people or the temple's wealth but had the idol hidden away at a secret location. The invader killed the people of Puri mercilessly and plundered all the temple wealth that they could. 3. Invasion by Feroz Shah Tughlaq (1360 A.D.) Feroz Shah Tughlaq attacked Puri when it was under the rule of the Ganga dynasty King Bhanudeva III. The king was not in Puri when the attack happened but when he reached with his army he found that Tughlaq had already left for Delhi. Nothing is known about his desecration or plunder of the temple. However some scholars believe that the idols were supposedly thrown in the sea by the invader but there’s no evidence to support this in history. 4. Invasion by Ismail Ghazi (1509 A.D.) Ismail Ghazi was the commander of the then Sultan of Bengal Allaudin Hussain Shah. Puri was then under the protection of King Prataprudradeva who was in the south at the time of the invasion. The priests of the temple sailed the three idols to an island in Chilika lake called “Chadeiguha pahada” (Bird-poop mountain) for their safekeeping. On getting the news of the invasion the King rushed back to protect Utkala and was successful in driving out the invaders to the point of Hooghly in Bengal. 5. Invasion by Kalapahada (1568 A.D.) Perhaps the most dreaded and the most discussed invasion on the Jagannath temple has to be this one by Kalapahada. The local folklore is full of dreaded stories of this man who had taken upon him to destroy all idols that the Hindus worshipped. King Mukundadeva was the ruler of Puri when Kalapahada one of the assistant army generals of the Afghan Sultan of Bengal Sulaiman Karrani. This expedition was commanded by Karrani’s son Bayazid and was assisted by Sikander Uzbeg and Kalapahada. The reason why Karrani decided to attack the kingdom was twofold. First Mukundadeva had given political asylum to Ibrahim Sur an enemy of the Sultan of Bengal. Second in 1566 A.D. when Mughal emperor Akbar had sent envoys to the court of Mukundadeva he reciprocated by sending a Hindu ambassador back to his court. These actions had created enough bad blood in the mind of the Afghani sultan against King Mukundadeva. When Kalaphada attacked King Mukundadeva sent Raghubhanja Chottray to resist the Bengal army but failed. Raghubhanja proved traitor and allowed Kalapahada to occupy Cuttack. King Mukundadeva had no choice but to surrender before the Bengal army. In the meantime Ramachandra Bhanja the commander of the Sarangagarh fort (Baranga) had rebelled against Mukundadeva declared himself the king of Odisha. Faced with no choice Mukundadeva entered into a treaty with Sulaiman and marched against Ramachandra Bhanja. Unfortunately that was the battle where he was killed by the latter and that marked the end of the last Hindu king of Odisha. Soon after on that very day Ramachandra Bhanja was killed by Bayazid the fort of Sarangagarh had now fallen. After the capture of forts at Cuttack and Sarangagarh Kalapahada led his army to desecrate the temple of Jagannath at Puri. In this meantime the servitors of Puri on hearing the fall of Cuttack to the Muslims had taken the idol away and were hidden underground at Hastipatna in Parikuda certain symbols had been used by the priests so that they could identify that hidden location. Unfortunately Kalahpahada could identify them and got the deities out. He carried them on elephant back to the banks of Ganga where he burnt them. The burning was in progress when he felt a splitting body pain his son pushed the half-burnt idols into the flowing river. A little downstream a Vaishnavite saint Bisher Mohanty who by some account had followed Kalapahada on his way back collected the “brahma” from the idols put it inside a mridanga and consecrated it at a temple in Gadakujanga of present-day Jagatsinghpur in Odisha. From 1568 to 1575 A.D. the brahma lived in that temple. In 1575 A.D. it was Ramachandra Deva who got the brahma from there and kept it at Khordha fort for a year. In 1576 A.D. after a Nabakalebara the deities were finally consecrated in the temple at Puri. 6. Invasion by Suleman and Osha (1592 A.D.) After the fall of the Gajapati kingdom in 1568 A.D. Suleiman Karrani had appointed Qutlu Khan Lohani as governor of Puri respectively. Qutlu Khan’s son — Suleman aided by another general of the Bengal sultan Isa Khan’s son Osha jointly attacked the temple at Puri. They plundered the temple wealth desecrated images at the temple and also killed innocent civilians mercilessly. This was the time when Ramachandradeva the Bhoi dynasty ruler had established the kingdom at Khurda. Though he didn’t face the invaders these invaders violated a treaty that was signed between Isa Khan and Raja Mansingh the Mughal general in 1590 A.D. The Mughal general finally suppressed the militant activities of these two invaders. 7. Invasion by Mirza Khurram (1601 A.D.) Mirza Khurram was the commander of the Nawab of Bengal who attacked Puri during the Dola festival (the one celebrated a day before Holi). The servitors got a whiff of it and shifted the idols by boat through river Bhargavi to Kapileswarpur village near Puri. When Mirza Khurram did arrive at the temple he couldn’t find the idols and just took away all the underground treasury. The deities lived at the Panchamukhi Gosani temple at Kapileswarpur celebrated the Dola festival there and thereafter were shifted to Dobandha Pentha where they stayed for 8 months with only “Shital Bhoga” offerings. 8. Invasion by Hasim Khan (1608 A.D.) Hasim Khan was the subedar of Odisha when he attacked the temple in 1608 A.D. This was the time when Purushottam Deva was the King of Khurda he got the deities to the Gopal temple at his capital even before Hasim reached Puri. Though he couldn’t find the deity just to satisfy his master then Mughal emperor Jahangir plundered the temple wealth and just left. King Purushottam Deva returned the idols back to the temple in 1608 A.D. 9. Invasion by Kesodamaru (1610 A.D.) Kesodamaru was a Hindu Rajput who served under Hasim Khan. He arrived in Puri during the rath yatra disguised as a pilgrim along with his faithful soldiers who were without military uniform. They entered the temple during the time when the deities were at the Gundicha temple. They converted it into a fort and looted crores worth of treasury of the temple. Unfortunately at that time King Purushottamdeva was not available at Puri. Upon hearing the news he rushed in with all his military might. His famous paikas (soldiers) jumped into the temple climbing on the chariots and fought against the Rajput invaders within the temple premises. Kesodamaru ordered his soldiers to burn the chariots that the paikas were using to enter the temple premises they did and killed a lot many paikas that way. The King accepted defeat and let the invaders escape. The deities remained at the Gundicha temple for 8 months before being brought back on Vimanas to the temple. 10. Invasion by Kalyan Mal (1611 A.D.) Kalyan Mal was the son of Raja Todar Mal one of the navaratnas in the Mughal court of Akbar. He ruled over Orissa as subedar from 1611 to 1617 A.D. after Hasim Khan. Like Kesodamaru he wanted to satisfy Jahangir by plundering the temple at Puri. He marched against the King of Khurda and captured many of his territories. King Purushottamdeva had no choice but to surrender before him. He even signed a treaty of peace and paid 3 lakhs rupees tribute to the royal exchequer gave up his best elephant Seshnag for use by the emperor. Even before the battle the servitors had moved the image to Mahisanasi in Chilika lake which is now called Brahmapura or Chakanasi. The idols remained there for a year before being brought back to the temple at Puri. The invader could only take the temple treasures. 11. Invasion by Kalyan Mal (1612 A.D.) Kalyan Mal had tried to attack the temple at Puri twice. In the first attack he not only looted the treasure but also treacherously murdered a minister of the king and sixteen skilled generals. When he attacked the second time the King was not present in Puri. However his brave paikas took up the cause to save the state. They were successful in pushing the invaders beyond the northern border of Cuttack killing many of his soldiers. The vigilant servitors took the deities on a fleet of boat from Mahisanasi to “Lotani Baragaccha” (banyan tree) and then after that they were placed at the Dadhibamana temple. That was the last time Kalyan Mal ever attacked the kingdom till his end of tenure in 1671 A.D. 12. Invasion by Mukarram Khan (1617 A.D.) In 1617 A.D. Mughal emperor Jahangir appointed Mukarram Khan as the governor of Odisha. Right from the start Mukarram Khan created a reign of terror and was very open about his display of hatred for idol worship. In a panic the temple priests carried the idols away to Gobapadar near Puri where they were placed at the Bankanidhi temple. Owing to the reign of terror that Mukarram Khan had created the then king Raja Purushottam Deva revolted. Mukarram Khan invaded Khurdha and since the King couldn’t stop it from happening he fled to Rajmundhry. The kingdom of Khurdha was annexed to the Mughals for a short time. Mukarram Khan failed to locate the deities and fled with the riches and gold but was drowned in water on the way back. Raja Purushottam Deva returned and instilled himself as the king of Khurda once again. It was only in 1620 A.D. that the deities returned again to Puri. 13. Invasion by Mirza Ahmad Beg (1621 A.D.) Mirza Ahmed Beg was the nephew of Mughal empress Noorjahan. Ahmed Beg became the governor of Odisha in 1621 A.D. He invaded Khurdha at a time when Purushottam Deva was trying to strengthen his position with the help of the chiefs of Banapur Ranapur and Karnata. It was at Karnata where he finally died and was to be succeeded by his son Narasingha Deva when Ahmed Beg intervened. Mirza Ahmed Beg put forward two conditions — the new emperor should accept Mughal sovereignty and that the governor’s family would be lodged at Cuttack. Narasimha Deva rejected both the terms. Out of anger Ahmed Beg attacked Khurda. The new king Narasingha Deva was successful in resisting the attack. However during this time the rebellious Mughal prince Shah Jahan arrived in Odisha with his army. Out of fear of being attacked Ahmed Beg fled to Bengal. Shah Jahan continued his march from Cuttack to Allahabad and Oudh across Odisha. This march of the Mughals prompted the priests to carry the idols to Andharigada at the mouth of river Shalia across the Chilika lake. Efforts were made the transfer the brahma to Gadamanitri in Khurda district. The trio was finally brought back to Puri in 1624 A.D. and the mahaprasad bhoga was re-introduced. 14. Invasion by Amir Mutaquad Khan (1645 A.D.) Also known as Mirza Makki he became the governor of Odisha in 1651 A.D. During his governorship the then King Narasimha Deva was treacherously killed by his nephew Gangadhar who occupied the throne. During the invasion he not only plundered the temple but also the old palace at Balisahi. The details about what happened to the idols or where they were hidden are not known. 15. Invasion by Amir Fateh Khan (1647 A.D.) Amir Fateh Khan attacked the temple and plundered all its wealth in gold gems stones pearls etc. The details about what happened to the idols or where they were hidden are not known. 16. Invasion by order of Aurangzeb (1692 A.D.) Emperor Aurangzeb issued an order in 1692 A.D. to destroy the temple of Jagannath in Puri. At the time the kingdom of Khurda was being ruled by Dibyasingha Deva. Following Aurangzeb’s order then Nawab of Odisha Ekram Khan along with his brother Mastram Khan attacked the temple. Unable to face the invader the king hid away in an unknown place. The deities were hidden behind the Bimala temple within the precincts of Srimandira. The Nawab attacked and ransacked the temple and even climbed up to the Ratna singhasana of Lord Jagannath. The idols were then shifted one after another to Maa Bhagabati temple at Gadakokal in Brahmagiri block (the Madalapanji states that it was only the Bije-Pratima and not the actual idols). The deities were then moved from Gadakokal to Banpur across the Chilika lake. It was only in 1699 A.D. that the Lord finally returned to the temple at Puri. 17. Invasion by Muhammad Taqi Khan (1731 A.D. and 1733 A.D.) Taqi Khan invaded the temple twice and with an iconoclastic zeal. He invaded to demolish the temple desecrate the idols plundered all he could. He was successful in everything except ever getting his hands on the trio. The priests moved the idols to Hariswar in Banapur then to Chikili in Khallikote then Rumagarh in Kodala then Athagada in Ganjam and then finally to Marda of Kodala. Kodala located in Athagada region was a safe place because it was under the rule of the Nizam of Hyderabad and not the Mughals. The ruler of Athagada Jagannath Harichandan Jagdev had strong relations with the Gajapati rulers of Khurda. The idols were kept at Marda from 29th December 1733 till 31st December 1736. A beautiful temple was hastily constructed at Marda and all rituals and festivals were religiously followed. It is even believed that the rath yatra was organized during this time as well. Marda is hence considered as Jagannath’s second home. After the Lord moved to Puri the temple remained vacant for centuries. Every Ekadasi day an earthen lamp is lit and slokas in honor of the King who made a second home for the Lord is recited. Around 1752 A.D. when the Maratha influence was high the then King Birakishore Deva was afraid of a Maratha invasion of the Jagannath temple. To allay his fears Maratha Dewan Bahadur Khan wrote a letter to the King assuring that no invasion would happen on the temple under the Maratha rule the worship of the Lord should continue without any more fear. 18. Invasion by followers of Mahima Dharma (1881 A.D.) The followers of Mahima Dharma don’t believe in idol worship and shunned the worship of Jagannath. So in the year of 1881 a large number of followers of Mahima dharma gathered in Puri from Sambalpur and Raipur and as per records got the three idols out onto the Grand Trunk Road and set them on fire. This was an incident that could have been avoided. But anyway an FIR was lodged and all the invaders were put behind the bars. The most significant feature in the history of invasion on the great temple of Lord Jagannath at Puri that in no case the ‘Brahma’ of the deities were destroyed which continued till today. The servitors played an important role in safeguarding the triad at the time of danger. The Kings havetaken care of the temple from destruction by surrendering before the invaders. In Ayodhya Kasi and Mathura the mosques have been built in place of the temples due to Muslim invasion. At Puri the temple of Lord Jagannath has always remained standing despite all invasions. No mosque had been erected which is the miracle of the deities. The people of Puri have suffered but kept the temple safe.,Jagannath Khuntia,https://www.quora.com/profile/Jagannath-Khuntia-8

Meaning of Hanuman in sanskrit is comes from two words. Hanu+Man . Hanu Means - Jaw. Man means Prominent. One who has prominent Jaw line is called Hanuman.Hanuman born to Anjana and Kesari. In ways he is also son of Vayu as there is association of Vayu in birth of hanuman. Anjana was worshiping Vayu for progeny. At the same time King Dasaratha was performing “Putra Kamesti yagya” for getting the child.At the end of Yagya the divine pudding (Payasam) to be shared by three of his wives leading to birth of Rama Lakshmana Bharatha and Satrukana.A kite sntached portion of it. This portion made to fall into hands of anjana by vayu who consumed it leading birth of Hanuman.Hence Hanuman is called Anjani putra as well as Vayu Putra. Hence hanuman is linked to Rama & LakshmanaHanuman Link to Surya: When Hanuman was in his youth and hungry he tried to grab to eat red-colored sun Mistaking it for a ripe fruit.Lord Indra intervened and struck Hanuman with his thunderbolt.It hit Hanuman on his jaw and he fell to the earth dead with a broken jaw. Hanuman's father Vayu (air) became upset and withdrew all the air on Earth. The lack of air created immense suffering to all living beings. Lord Shiva intervened and resuscitated Hanuman which in turn prompted Vayu to return to the living beings.Hence Hanuman gets the blessings of Lord Shiva that no negative energy can stand infront of him as he is the lord of Atharvana Veda with the blessings of Lord ShivaAs the mistake was done by Indra he grants Hanuman a wish that his body would be as strong as Indra's Vajra and that his Vajra can also not harm him.Vayu granted his ability to fly wind won’t affect him. Agni granted he won’t be affected by fire. Varuna granted he won’t be harmed by Water. Lord Brahma Granted he can visit any place that he won’t be stopped.Hence these blessings made Lord Hanuman to be granted with Unique Powers & Strength.Hanuman Chalisa: Hanuman Chalisa is attributed to Tulsidas a poet-saint who lived in the 16th century CE.Chalisa is derived from the Hindi word chalis - which means “forty.” The Hanuman Chalisa is therefore so-called because it has 40 verses that praise Hanuman Benefits of Reciting Hanuman Chalisa:It provides strength courage success prosperity in life. Reciting Hanuman Chalisa will also ward off negative energies and spirits. It is believed to remove bad karma. Why 7 Times? Surya the sun god gave him the power to change the size of his body. The sun god has seven horses to pull his heavenly chariot.In the Rigveda there are seven parts of the world seven seasons and seven heavenly fortresses. There are Seven colors and represent energy in different wavelengthSeven worlds in the universe and seven seas in the world in Hindu cosmology. Seven sages or Saptarishi and their seven wives or Sapta Matrka in Hindu mythologyThere are Seven above lokas above Seven Lokas BelowThere are Seven Chakras in the Human bodyThere are sapta Kannika also known as Sapta Matas. Namely Brahmi Indrani maheswari Gowmari Vaishnavi Varahi Chamundi. Very Popular / Powerful deities in southern part of India tradition.There are Sapta Swara in Music which has enormous impact on the worldThe seven rivers mentioned in the Rig-Veda are Indus Vitasta (Vehit/Jhelum) Asikni (Chenab) Prusni/Eravati (Ravi) Vipasha (Beas) Sutudri (Sutlej) and Sarasvati (which dried up).So by Reciting the Hanuman Chalisa one gets the blessings of Sun ( His Seven Rays) Sapta Rishi All the powers of All worlds All Deities My prayers to everyone to Recite Hanuman chalisa to get the blessings of lord Hanuman to remove negativity from their life and make their life prosperous and Happy.Please Up-Vote and Share the answer to spread the message of Our Sanatana Dharma and Deity Regards Dr.Nadathur Srivatchan Vedic Astrologer & Spiritual Mentor,Nadathur Srivatchan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Nadathur-Srivatchan

This is the only reason why we never had mass killing over 1000’s of years as in almost every other part of the world where one religion concentrated on eliminating the other because of some perceptive difference in each other's belief systems.

It simply means non-believer and it refers to atheists. And since Hindus do believe in God they aren't actually kafirs. Hindus are mushriks i.e. people having a concept of God different from Islam (this includes polytheism idolatry henotheism etc).Islam doesn't teach us to kill every non-Muslim around us. Every single verse of the Quran that talks about fighting is related to some battle or the other that was raging between the Muslims and the hostile tribes around them. You can find the context of every such verse in the verses preceding or succeeding it. Remember apart from being a religious entity Islam also emerged as a political entity. Prophet Mohammad in addition to being a spiritual leader was also the political leader of the newly formed and growing Muslim empire. As for dealing with general non-Muslims around us Quran clearly and unambiguously states the following:Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed Allah loves those who act justly.(Quran 60:8) The all-covering black baggy thing called Burqa isn't mandatory in Islam. (Alqama's answer to Why don't all Muslim wear Burqa?)Saudi Arabia isn't our Vatican nor the King of Saudi our Pope. So whatever Saudi or its king does has no relevance to us. Nor are they the guardians of Islam or the descendants of the Prophet. Just the twin cities of Mecca and Madina are our holy sites. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia came into existence only in 1932.We aren't running any Love Jihad racket. Deception and lying are among the biggest sins in Islam. Nor are we plotting to turn India into an Islamic state. We have got a normal life just like you. We work in the IT sector the PSUs malls schools as entrepreneurs journalists drivers businessmen etc etc.Edit: Clarified the meaning of mushrik.,Alqama,https://www.quora.com/profile/Alqama-1

Getting a strong grasp on such a diverse range of languages and applications is a steep learning curve. Of course this is one of the causes behind the current global lack of data science specialists as well as the strong demand for them.Data Science and Why it is Considered Hard Data has been created at an astronomical rate as a result of the internet's rapid expansion and the abrupt rise in computer hardware capabilities. Because of this a variety of businesses are now storing this data. To put it simply data science is the scientific method of evaluating data and constructing prediction models that examine the data's underlying patterns and establish the link between the many elements of the goal and the data. If you want to get into it you'll have to work hard. Although some of the reasons for data science is seen as difficult may appear overstated there are certain areas of data science that may be deemed difficult. Is Data Science a Difficult Field to Work In? It's because of the demanding nature of Data Science that it's sometimes seen as difficult. In order to become an expert in Data Science one must have a solid grounding in a wide range of subjects including:PythonPython is a must-have yet it has a relatively easy learning curve. Many Data Scientists prefer Python to other programming languages because of its accessibility ease of use and versatility. 2. R R is distinct from other platforms since it was designed specifically for data analytics earning it a reputation for being more difficult to learn than other analytics software. Even if you've worked with other data science tools before R may seem unfamiliar at first. It's well worth the effort though because it includes practically every statistical and data visualization tool a Data Scientist could require including neural networks non-linear regression advanced graphing and more. 3. SQL. Another absolute must-have. Fortunately SQL is a reasonably simple accessible and intuitive language. Because its commands are limited to queries it takes only two or three weeks for beginners and significantly less for expert programmers to learn. You'll be able to update query modify alter and extract information from structured sets of data especially massive databases once you've learned SQL. Languages for Data Science There are several data science languages that can potentially have more specific uses in addition to the main data programming languages Python SQL and R:The Java programming languageScala.The MATLAB softwareAnyone who wants to become an expert in this profession will have to put in a lot of time and effort since it's a fusion of many different disciplines. In order to debug a model aspirant Data Scientists must be well-versed in mathematics and statistics since many predictive algorithms rely on these ideas. Some coding knowledge is required for implementation using R or Python. At the same time Data Science is a Good Career Option: The title of ""sexiest job of the twenty-first century"" belongs to the field of data science for a reason. A Data Scientist's amount of exposure difficulties and ability to impact corporate decision-making make it a very powerful role in the workplace. Data scientists are in short supply making them an excellent career choice since they are in high demand. Furthermore if one becomes an expert in this sector the possibilities are almost limitless for those who are passionate about data science. It is also crucial to note that the typical annual income for a Data Scientist in India may range from Rs. 10 lakh to Rs. 25 lakh making it one of the most lucrative professions in the country due to the strong demand for data scientists and the high compensation they get.

This issue is very old and was resolved long time ago. Imam al-Ghazzali one of the most famous Muslim scholars writing almost a thousand years ago reported several Ahadith and came to the following conclusion: “All these Ahadith are reported by al-Bukhari and singing and playing are not haram.” Al-Ghazzali also convincingly answered many critics who had raised such objections in his book “Ihya Ulum al-Deen.” Those who are opposed to music quote this Hadith: “Bukhari Volume 7 Book 69 Number 494v: Narrated Abu ‘Amir or Abu Malik Al-Ash’ari: that he heard the Prophet saying “From among my followers there will be some people who will consider illegal sexual intercourse the wearing of silk the drinking of alcoholic drinks and the use of musical instruments as lawful. And there will be some people who will stay near the side of a mountain and in the evening their shepherd will come to them with their sheep and ask them for something but they will say to him ‘Return to us tomorrow.’ Allah will destroy them during the night and will let the mountain fall on them and He will transform the rest of them into monkeys and pigs and they will remain so till the Day of Resurrection.”It is dangerous to form an opinion on the basis of one or two Hadiths and Hadith literature should be considered as raw data. Each Hadith should be evaluated and compared with other Ahadith as well as with other historical sources. The problem is that we usually don’t know the context of each Hadith and it is difficult to know under what circumstances the Prophet (s.a.w) made certain statements. The above Hadith most likely refers to musical instruments used in drinking parties during the period of “jahiliyaa” (pre-Islamic era) in which even men wore silk clothes and orgies included illegal sexual intercourse. Taken by itself the Hadith should also ban silk but that is not the case and silk is permitted for women. That is why it is important to look at all Ahadith and not come to a hasty conclusion. There are other Ahadiths which clearly show that musical instruments are permitted: For example this Hadith: “Volume 6 Book 61 Number 568: Narrated Abu Musa:That the Prophet said to him’ ‘O Abu Musa! You have been given one of the musical wind-instruments of the family of David .’” Critics also argue that music instruments are ONLY allowed during festivities. They quote this Hadith:Bukhari Volume 2 Book 15 Number 72: Narrated Aisha: Abu Bakr came to my house while two small Ansari girls were singing beside me the stories of the Ansar concerning the Day of Buath. And they were not singers. Abu Bakr said protestingly “Musical instruments of Satan in the house of Allah’s Apostle !” It happened on the ‘Id day and Allah’s Apostle said “O Abu Bakr! There is an ‘Id for every nation and this is our ‘Id.”That Hadith again has to be studied in proper context because the Prophet (pbuh) not only permitted singing on other occasions he recommended it. “Aishah narrated that when her relative was married to an Ansari man the Prophet (s.a.w) said: ‘Aishah did they have any entertainment? The Ansar are fond of Entertainment.” He didn’t say they were fond of entertainment only on festivities or that it was wrong but allowed on some occasions. In another Hadith “Ibn Abbas said ‘Aishah gave a girl relative of hers in marriage to a man of the Ansar. The Prophet (s.a.w) came and asked ‘Did you send a singer along with her?’ ‘No’ she said. The Messenger of Allah then said: ‘The Ansar are a people who love poetry. You should have sent along someone who would sing ‘here we come to you we come greet us as we greet you.'” Music-haters also reference this Hadith:“Anas ibn Malik related from the Prophet (saws) that “two cursed sounds are that of the musical instrument(mizmaar) played on the occasion of joy and grace and the woeful wailing upon the occasion of adversity.”It is not difficult to find contradictory Ahadith. However almost all scholars of Islam are of the view that singing is not only permitted it is recommended on the occasions of Eid weddings births aqiqahs and on the return of a traveler. {See Yusuf al-Qardawi’s “The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam.”] Qardawi in the same book also states the following: “It is reported that many Companions of the Prophet (may Allah be pleased with them) as well as second generation Muslim scholars used to listen to singing and did not see anything wrong with it. As for the Ahadith which have been reported against singing they all are weak and have been shown by researchers to be unsound. The jurist Abu Bakr al-Arabi says ‘No sound Hadith is available concerning the prohibition of singing’ while Ibn Hazm says ‘ All that is reported on this subject is false and fabricated…he who listens to singing intending neither obedience nor disobedience in doing something neutral and harmless which is similar to going to the park and walking around standing by a window and looking at the sky wearing blue or green clothes and so on.'” The best answer was given by Ibn Hazm who quoted another verse: “And what is beyond the truth except error?” (Quran 10:32). In other words those who are prohibiting something which God has not forbidden for no apparent reason are simply falling into error. Then there are some Muslims who argue that only drums are allowed. That too is false. Note the Hadith that I have quoted above:“Narrated Abu Musa: “That the Prophet said to him ‘O Abu Musa! You have been given one of the musical wind-instruments of the family of David.'”That makes it obvious that Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w) was not opposed to wind instruments. So there goes your “drums are OK” theory. Secondly what is permitted on Eid day is also permitted on other days. There is not a single Hadith which says that what is permitted for Eid is not acceptable on other days. Muslims have been enjoying Music since the beginning of Islam with no guilt whatsoever.,Shaheer Khan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Shaheer-Khan-3

My father stopped the boat and asked them about the reason for their request. These people told him that they have been force fed beef by Muslims and as a result they have become Muslim. They didn’t want to become Muslims but they didn’t know how to come back to Hinduism. My dad told them to immediately bathe in Ganga if they wanted to become Hindus since the Ganga water can absolve anyone of all sins. The crowd believed him and bathed in the Ganga river and became Hindus again. This is a true incident. Only you can answer if eating beef will make you a non-Hindu. If you know the real spiritual basis for the ban on eating beef then you will most likely not consider yourself a non-Hindu. You may read this answer to know what is the spiritual meaning of the ban on killing a cow. Pradip Gangopadhyay's answer to Why are cows considered holy animals in Hinduism(sanatana dharma)?

This is one of the question that vexes society. In one sense I do not like non-Hindus to visit temples because their motive is not worship they come to gawk at what is exotic to them and take a flurry of pictures.  I was recently in Arunachala and there a group of women were lighting multiple lamps in a single plate and were doing aradhana at a shrine. Then comes along a white lady with her camera and start taking pictures the ladies got distracted and started posing for the camera to the end that the white women was directing them on how to stand to get the best light etc. And in the meantime bhava was lost. Who is to blame here? But then there is no guarantee that every Hindu who visits a temple has similar devotion. Nor is that all non-Hindus come to gawk as tourists. So it is a call the temples have to make there is no perfect solution to such.  In my opinion given my experience of Abrahamic religions where they think to pray to ""idols"" is bizarre and exotic. I rather fall on the other side of the line that they should not be allowed to visit the Shrines. A Hindu can visit a Church or a Mosque for a simple reason that a Hindu does not consider such a worship as pagan heathen or mushrik. The Hindu does not stand in judgement. But Abrahamics do stand in judgement upon other religions. I do not want to invite someone to my home knowing that their motives are thus. And I don't want my heritage to be gawked at or our practices - as though we are performing monkeys in a circus act. Sure there will be exceptions to this but it is near impossible to verify. So for now I think it is better policy to keep them away.  Be it USCIRF or people like Jeffery Kripal trusting them and giving them access has turned out to be a bad choice for us. For they end up demeaning what we value.  We should stop being suckers for the ""white person's opinion"" we are proud that they appreciate our art heritage etc. But every time this has lead to that particular art or custom being stripped of its dharmic moorings and marketed as a ""secularized"" exotic product and slowly appropriated. I know it is not intuitive for us to be suspicious. But it is better we learn from History.",Raghu Bhaskaran,https://www.quora.com/profile/Raghu-Bhaskaran

Temples in Rawalpindi: My home city Rawalpindi had one of the largest Hindu community before the partition of India. It was probably the only city in modern day Pakistan (alongwith Karachi) with slight Hindu and Sikh majority. I can safely assume there are still many temples in old Rawalpindi than any other city of Pakistan. But due to mass migration of Hindus at the time of 1947 all of these temples are closed. Despite 70 years you can still count there are as many temples in Rawalpindi than Mosques in the pictures.Kalyan Das Temple (Rawalpindi)Temple near Chittian Hattian Rawalpindi:Bagh Sardaran Hindu Temples (Rawalpindi)Krishna Mandir Saddar: (The only active Mandir in Rawalpindi)We cannot deny the cultural legacy of Hinduism in Pakistan and we all Pakistanis should play our important part to preserves these sites.

The divinity of Rama was something Ravana was not aware of so from his perspective it is a mere human who is way younger to him defeated him with utmost ease. This is the words of Ravana:""All that great penance performed by me became a waste indeed for I who am equal to Mahendra the Lord of Celestials have been defeated by a mere man! The terrible words of Brahma the Lord of Creation saying 'You know of the threat from men' appear true. That is so. I sought immunity from death at the hands of celestials titans or celestials musicians or semi-divine beings or demons or serpent demons but of man I made no mention. Rama the son of Dasaratha is the man I think of whom Anaranya born of Ikshvaku dynasty formerly spoke saying: ‘O the worst of demons the worst of your race and the wretched one! In my race will be born a man who will slay you in battle with your sons ministers army horses and charioteer."" ~ Valmiki Ramayana Yuddha Khanda Sarga 60.Ravana’s reaction was pretty natural and expected. He was a person who never faced any defeat possessed all the celestial missiles gained boons from Mahadeva and Brahma and yet lost to a mere human. Had I been in his shoes even I would have reacted the same way.This is very important scene and Sarga in my view. It shows that Ravana a very overpowered Rakshasa became pathetic and hopless. This is the point where Ravana truly knew he had already lost the war but still his ego is so high that he sent his brothers and son to fight even though he knew that they would die as Ravana himself the strongest among the Rakshasas could do nothing to Rama whom he considered as a mere mortal.

Supporting arguments:He was humiliated by Draupadi but he gave Karna the status that no one have gave to a lower rank individual so he was not really an evil but a human same as other Pandavas who also did cheat many times. And why Draupadi is adored by everybody as she seems like a very arrogant woman who cares only about her interests. She never showed any great quality to many other ladies of his time.If I fall into any misery and somebody laugh at my face (just not some old lady or man) i'll slap whatever the gender .Also she insulted Karna so she was given same insulting treatment. Where was there any Adharma in that? What is the good message in this context of Mahabharata?Now to answer: Duryodhana never obeyed his elders not even his father and mother. He tried to murder his cousins multiple times. He insulted wise men and sages. Not satisfied with cheating his cousins out of their kingdom out of a rigged game tried to molest their wife and his sister-in-law sent his cousins to forest made them follow one year of slavery incognito tried to humiliate them in the forest (but was humiliated himself) refused to restore the kingdom to Yudhishthira even after completing the terms of the bet tried to capture and kill the messenger of peace (Krishna) caused the death of all his brothers relations and millions of soldiers. And you want to call him ""not bad""? Something seriously wrong with you friend. In the Kali Yuga there are lot of Duryodhana sympathizers. Well this is Kali Yuga; so this is expected. But everyone has the right to question ""why?"". Let us first inspect Duryodhana's claim to the throne. Rewind years (ages) ago. Emperor Bharata ruled India of those times. Indeed India is called Bharatavarsha after Bharata. At the time of his death Bharata appointed his foster son as his worthy successor bypassing his biological and elder sons. He claimed that they did not have the qualities of the king. So the throne of Hastinapur was not automatically the right of the eldest prince. Fast forward a little. Five generations ago before Kauravas and Pandavas Hastinapur was ruled by King Prateepa. Prateepa had three sons - Devapi the eldest Balhika the second and Shantanu the third and youngest. Devapi contacted leprosy. He declared himself unfit to rule and retired to the forest. Balhika went north and somewhere in modern Tajikistan area formed his own kingdom called Balhikas; he renounced his right to Hastinapur. So Shantanu the grandfather of Dhritarashtra became the king. Hastinapur had a set tradition - only a physically sound prince can become the king. Fast forward a little more. Dhritarashtra and Pandu are of age. Bhishma wants to crown Dhritarashtra the king but Vidura their step brother the incarnation of Dharma himself and the wisest man on Earth objected saying a blind person cannot even protect himself and hence unfit to become a protector of the kingdom. The throne went to Pandu. So Dhritarashtra lost the right to the throne. (Inconsistent readers who have not read the mythology properly or failed to understand this fail to see these points. They just think that the eldest prince has an automatic right to the throne). Pandu's renunciation After Pandu was cursed he renounced the throne and went to the forest. Dhritarashtra became a king in proxy. Later on Yudhishthira was born to Pandu and Kunti. A year later Duryodhana was born to Dhritarashtra. By the grace and boon of Sage Vyasa 99 more princes and 1 princess was born to Gandhari and Dhritarashtra (all a month apart). They were known as Kauravas. Pandu showed no intention of returning. He sired four more children. They were called Pandavas. Sixteen years after the birth of Yudhishthira Pandu died as per the curse of Sage Kindama. The fatherless Pandavas returned to Hastinapur with their mother Kunti. All this time Duryodhana was led to believe that his father was the king and he was the heir apparent. All this changed. Now a tussle began. Duryodhana saw that his cousins were more accomplished and Yudhishthira was clearly the favoured one by the other elders. This started the jealousy which turned into intense hatred. He tried to murder his cousin Bhima by poisoning. Granted that Bhima sometimes bullied his cousins but attempting to murder is definitely evil. Not to be outdone Duryodhana made a second attempt burn his cousins and their old mother alive in a specially constructed House of Lac. Pure evil personified. But Pandavas survived all attempts to murder and then they married Draupadi. Now with the alliance of Panchalas and the Yadavas they had become very powerful. Dhritarashtra was forced to invite them back to Hastinapur. Reluctantly he partitioned the kingdom into two halves and gave one of the halves (the barren/arid part) to Pandavas. Yudhishthira accepted this humbly and with their efforts Pandavas built a much better kingdom. Now if Duryodhana's claim to throne was still valid in some minds after the partition all his claim was forfeited. He was now the heir apparent to Hastinapur and no right to Indraprastha. Hence all Duryodhana's deeds from that point on the deceitful game of dice the molestation of Draupadi the second deceitful game of dice banishing of Pandavas to forest etc. were all BAD ACTS nay HORRIBLY EVIL ACTS. Duryodhana's evil acts did not end there.Duryodhana and Karna Duryodhana did not favour Karna because of his lower status. First the ""suta"" is not a low caste like some ""tangewala"". Secondly Duryodhana never showed any favour to other lower born like Vidura Yuyutsu Pratikami his slaves etc. He showed favour to Karna for one reason only - at last he saw that there was someone who was equal to Arjuna. He considered himself equal to Bhima and now that he had Karna he felt that his 99 brothers can easily overcome the other 3 Pandavas. All this idea of friendship and consideration for lower born etc. is a hogwash. Duryodhana showered gifts only on those who were his ""yes-men"" and Karna was the foremost amongst his ""yes-men"". Later on perhaps he did feel a great respect admiration and love for Karna but again because Karna would advise Duryodhana on what he wanted to hear.Draupadi Draupadi did not laugh at Duryodhana in Maya Sabha. She did not taunt him with the words ""blind man's son is also blind"". This is a complete myth and not supported by any authentic book on Mahabharata. When Duryodhana fell into the magical pond of water that looked like firm marble floor Draupadi was not present and not even a witness. She was deep inside the women's chamber. As far as Draupadi insulting Karna in swayamvar there are two thoughts. The BORI CE says that Karna tried to string the bow and shoot the target but failed. KMG's version and a few others say that Draupadi said that she will not marry someone who is a Suta. The Suta caste is considered a lower caste than Kshatriya. As per the ancient Vedic customs a marriage between higher caste woman and lower caste man was considered was called ""Pratiloma"" and not generally sanctioned but sometimes took place. A ""Suta"" is a son of a pratiloma marriage between Kshatriya man and Brahmin woman. So in the first case Draupadi was justified in saying so - if she did say so. Now even if we agree that Draupadi refused Karna because of his caste does this really justify Karna's insult? Indeed then you are justifying the jilted males who throw acid over the girl because she rejected him. Is the OP seriously considering that ""Karna calling Draupadi a prostitute a slave who should be disrobed in front of men"" is not adharma? Gimme a break please. Draupadi was not an arrogant woman. Forget the serials. They tend to hyperventilate. That is the business they are in. Even Shakuni is not the character that he is often shown. Draupadi never insulted anyone. But she was a proud woman. She was born out of fire. When she was insulted dragged to the court (in her condition) molested she demanded revenge. Is that being arrogant? Please put your mother sister or wife in her position and then let me know what she thinks and how she behaves.

In fact Hindus ended their lives in Vanaprasth Ashrama living in forests/hermitage away from civilization in godly meditation. From the examples of Rishis the omnipresent God is best found within through inner comtemplation and meditation and hence Self realization is equated to God realization. That said for an average believer an idol and a group activity at temples spur leaning to God which could lead to His discovery within.,Shanker Janakiraman,https://www.quora.com/profile/Shanker-Janakiraman-1

Just learn thisPrakriti = material reality and Purusha = spiritual reality Material reality is to please our five senses. Sight Hearing Taste Smell and touch are the five senses that we have. We work and do everything to please them. Every little and big thing you do in your life is to please one or all of these. From cleaning your house to visiting romantic places and tasting exotic foods.Apart from this material reality contains Art Music Sex Pleasure Prosperity etc. Material reality is impermanent; Sooner or later it withers away. Today you are eating the best food tomorrow you may have a great financial loss and you won’t be able to afford what you can afford now. With this there comes a stage where you become restless frustrated in pain anxiety stress fear and all sorts of emotions. So Now Prakriti = material reality = Unstable Purusha or spiritual growth is the ability to over the power of these emotions so that one has the wisdom to appreciate and enjoy all things material without getting needy or clingy So Now Purusha = Spiritual reality = StableOk I think you got the basic idea of Prakriti and Purusha. Now Think of our human body. The heart is on the left side so the side is unstable. and so that side i.e. the left side of a body is considered as Prakriti Side.So eventually the right side being stable is Purusha Side and that’s why told you to step the right foot first!,Amayra Sharma,https://www.quora.com/profile/Amayra-Sharma-17

The temple complex actually contains 9 temples in it. But during Islamic invasion all the temples were destroyed. However the archeological department people managed to find the ruins of 8 temples and reconstructed them. The ruins of one temple still remains missing. The Islamic rulers not only destroyed the temple complex but also converted the site into a Muslim graveyard. Below are the pics taken from my mobile. Look at the temple architecture how beautiful it is. Just imagine how beautiful it would've been if not destroyed.Now this is the graveyard I'm talking about. You can see the temples around it.

RelatedWhy is Ramcharitmanas hailed above Gita Vedas Itihasas and Puranas? What is the real reason behind?,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Ramcharitmanas-hailed-above-Gita-Vedas-Itihasas-and-Puranas-What-is-the-real-reason-behind,,Because of Simplicity. Anyone can read and understand it. I can even say that “Ramcharitmanas” alone is sufficient for bhakti. various things that would take days to understand from Gita or Upanishads can easily be understood from Ramcharitmanas. A Vedanti when studies Ramcharitmanas he could see parallel dohas for every important concepts of Vedas Itihaas and Purans. Take a example: भोक्ता भोग्यं प्रेरितारं च मत्वा सर्वं प्रोक्तं त्रिविधं ब्रह्ममेतत् ॥ श्वेताश्वतर उप.१.१२॥ //BhOktA BhOgyam PrEritAram cha matvA sarvam prOktam trividham Brahmam Etat// यस्मात्क्षरमतीतोऽहमक्षरादपि चोत्तमः। अतोऽस्मि लोके वेदे च प्रथितः पुरुषोत्तमः।। (गीता 15.18) //yasmātkṣaramatītō.hamakṣarādapi cōttamaḥ. atō.smi lōkē vēdē ca prathitaḥ puruṣōttamaḥ৷৷// परवश जीव स्ववश भगवंता जीव अनेक एक श्रीकंता।। //parvash jeev swavash bhagwanta; jeev anek ek shrikanta// (Except the husband of Sri all are jeevatmas.) उभय बीच सीय सोभति कैसे जीव ब्रह्म बिच माया जैसे।। //ubhay beech Siya sohati kaise; jeev brahm beech maya jaise// (Jeev Brahm and Maya are three eternal truths.) ज्ञान अखंड एक सीतावर माया बस जीव सचराचर। जो सबके रहे ज्ञान एकरस ईश्वर जीवहिं भेद कहहु कस।। (रामचरितमानस) Read yourself and decide which is more clear to comprehend? Lord Shankar himself stamped it with his singnature and put this shastra above Ved Itihaas and Purans. Comparing with valmiki Ramayan In the story of jayanta valmiki goes on the decribe in long how the crow hit the chest of Sita how the blood was oozing. It’s certainly not a correct description for a putra. In Ramcharitmanassita charan chonch hati bhaga The crow Jayanta hit with his chonch (beak) and feet.But where?chala rudhir raghunayak jaaga blood flow reached and awakened Ram.Now Ram was sleeping in the lap of Sita. So obviously the blood is coming from upside. Tulsi said everything but he didn't said anythingmarm vachan sita jab boli hari prerit lakshman mati doliWhat’s the ‘marm vachan? Valmiki describes in detail. Also Valmiki description of thighs and chest of Sita (although from the perspective of third person) is not suited for putra-bhaav.

Pushiyamirta Shunga and Lord Rama are two different person Pushiyamirta Shunga was a historical king who lived in the 2nd century BCE while Lord Rama is a divine figure an incarnation of Lord Vishnu who is believed to have lived at an earlier time approximately in the 8th century BCE. It's worth noting that the Ramayana is a poem and the story of Lord Rama is a mythological tale and the exact timing of the story is not clear. Some versions of the Ramayana place Rama in a much earlier time period while others place him in a later time period.

RelatedWho is considered God in Advaita Vedanta?,https://www.quora.com/Who-is-considered-God-in-Advaita-Vedanta,,In Advaita Vedanta God is never an object! When God is not an object the question of description does not arise. How can we describe something that is not an object? God is not something that is perceived by our senses. God is not something that can be imagined! Is it possible for any animal to imagine the concept of a religion or a creator? Is it ever possible for a computer to visualize its creator? The human being is always curious to know God and in the bargain falls into the grip of dogmas. Advaita Vedanta says “Instead of looking for God outside as an object sit quietly and introspect. Who is this person introspecting?” This introspecting subject is like a salt doll which jumped in to gauge the depth of ocean but never surfaced again to declare the ocean’s depth. ‘Realizing -God’ is not a process to be undertaken. The state of the ‘wholesale emptying’ of everything that this physical body/mind with its five senses has acquired as conditioning during its life on this earth is a prerequisite to realize this subject ‘God’. God is a subjective state devoid of any sensory memory! It is the very existence of the seeker and consciousness of this existence. Consciousness-Existence is the ultimate substratum which forms the backdrop of this moving universe. This unmoving stable backdrop is indeed ‘YOU’ the ultimate “I” consciousness that appears as soon as we wake up from a deep slumber. Consciousness-Existence devoid of any externality is ‘God’ if you insist on the name ‘God’. Otherwise strictly speaking you are not there to utter the word ‘God’ when you are already ‘God’!

It's more about the intricate carvings and illustrations as opposed to towering gopurams (temple towers ). Coming to the topic the temple that fascinates me and has something new to offer every time I visit it is this one below.The Channakeshava temple in Belur a small town in Hassan district of Karnataka . Built by Hoysala King Vishnuvardhana ( correct me if I'm wrong )  this beautiful piece of architecture is known for its ornately carved pillars and the beautiful carvings on its outer walls. Hoysala style of temple architecture is characterised by its spacious courtyard raised platform on which an star ( octagonal usually ) shaped temple stands majestically. The gopuram of the inner sanctum is not that high and the temple houses illustrations of life during the Hoysala empire epics like Ramayana Mahabharata and minute intricate carvings. Let me show you some of the many wonders that you get to see in the temple .The pillars inside the main buildingEach pillar inside the temple is unique and depicts a story. They were carved using lathe like mechanism and can be seen in a variety of shapes. One particular pillar is carved inside out i.e. multiple layers of carvings on a single pillar. And you can just see the how detailed the patterns are .  The below one is my personal favorite !The ceiling inside the temple.Inside the main temple  a circular dias commonly seen in any South Indian temple is surrounded by 4 pillars each with its own idols and carvings . Just looming above is a ceiling that consists of unique circular patterns and at its centre is an inverted cylinder with Lord Narasimha's image carved on it. It is believed that when seen under light from all 4 corners the image appears to be different and you can see guides explaining it in much more detail in the temple. You have to see it to behold the marvel that it is.This sculptureCommonly seen across Karnataka this sculpture is of a man killing a tiger or a mythical animal close to our national animal( also called Shalabha or Sharabha but I'm not sure ). It's as famous as our Gandabherunda.The Shilabalike sculptures ( celestial nymphs )And how can I forget to mention about these exquisite and most beautiful sculptures ? Belur temple is most fondly remembered for its Shilabalike  the depiction of celestial nymphs or apsaras in various poses and actions. There are around 40 of these sculptures high on the outer walls of the temple and they are perfect representations of the female sexuality and divinity . The most popular among them is Darpana Sundari ( Beauty holding a mirror ) . These beautiful sculptures need almost a couple of hours of your time to truly enjoy their beauty and laud the craftsmanship of the sculptor.Darpana Sundari above  A Shilabalike playing drums ( one of the 4 sculptures inside the temple ) I can just go on and on about this temple . It is the most architecturally brilliant structure I have witnessed in my life. There is so much to see and so much to wonder. Also  for all devotees of Lord Krishna  Lord Channakeshava himself is magnificent to behold and you will definitely end up adoring him. Some more pics of Beluru Channakeshava temple -      As an added bonus there is another Hoysala temple in Halebidu  just 20 odd kilometers away from Belur . It is also equally stunning and has a museum of ruins and sculptures from Hoysala period. Next time whenever you visit Karnataka  do not  I repeat  Do Not skip Belur . You'll miss out on a masterpiece .,Raghu Joshi,https://www.quora.com/profile/Raghu-Joshi-5

The shastra and especially Puranas and Mahabharata mention that the present compilation of the sruti was put down in writing at the beginning of Kali Yuga because people would gradually lose memory intelligence and wisdom so they needed some ready reference. From that point in time the Rishis could see the inevitable development of the disaster and its consequences but because the future is never really set in stone their forecast was not a “prophecy” as a sort of curse as in the abrahamic sense. This means that we still have a lot of space for free will and proper action. Reality is like a river: we know it starts from the source and ends in the ocean and flows from a higher point that a lower point collecting water as it goes and digging a course for itself in this process and contributing to the geography of the territory. But there is much we can do about the river itself and sufficient effort can effect a lot of change. For the better or for the worse. According to the Vedic view human beings are not supposed to sit back “surrender and pray” waiting for God (Kalki Vishnu Shiva Durga etc) to put things right. Of course we surrender and pray TO BECOME INSTRUMENTS (nimitta matra bhava savyasacin) to better work and serve the universal good that is the benefit of all beings by upholding and protecting dharma the human equivalent of the cosmic rita. But we need to really understand what dharma is otherwise we will cause more problems than solutions. God manifests whenever dharma declines and adharma grows (yada yada hi dharmasya glanir bhavati abhyutthanam adharmasya tad atmanam srijyami aham) for the mission of protecting the good people destroying the evil doers and re-establishing the correct understanding of dharma (paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya cha duskritam dharma samsthapana arthaya sambhavami yuge yuge). But Krishna speaks these words on the battlefield of Kurukshetra to convince Arjuna to fight. Krishna himself will not fight in that battle: this much has been made abundantly clear.,Parama Devi,https://www.quora.com/profile/Parama-Devi

First claim that idol (moola virat) is not shown is completely false as there exist a Seva at Tirupati call Nijapada Darshanam on friday where idol is decorated with minimal ornaments any one can see the idol of deity clearly wearing just a lowin cloth. Yes it is true that there are no recent pictures of the deity without any decoration but there exists a rare video of the deity in black and white taken during british time. This video is the only authentic source of the idol available. Picture from the video is attached below.tirupati original idol video Skip to 39 minutes in the video link attached above to watch original video of idols abhishekam without any ornaments and decorations. As you can see clearly lord has a attached crown itself . No jain idol has any kind of crown adorned with it. Idol can be seen with a dhothi also crafted with stone none of these features match any jain idol. Claim that lords curly hair is covered with the golden crown. Yes it is true that lord has long curly hair on his back unlike curly hair of any jain idol. Also curly hair is not distinct for only jaina sculptures most of stone idols of many relegions bare this resemblance. 2. As for the second claim that the idol is of Lord Neminath is completely baseless. This is the digambara idol of lord Neminatha.This is the replica idol of lord Balaji.As one can see clearly that there are no astounding resemblances to the two idols. Lord Balaji’s pose is unique in stance having four hands two raised upwards and lower right hand showing Varada hasta and left hand showing Kati hasta. Lord has Godess Lakshmi crafted on his chest. On stark contrast jain idols normally never have any ornaments crown and that distinct pose of the idol at Tirupati crafted within the stone idol. Moola virat(idol) of lord is very special and is believed to be extra terrestrial object. Many miracles have happened over the years proving lords existance. So it can be ruled out that the idol belongs to Lord Neminath. 3. Third claim is interesting as it is 100% true that lord does not have any shanka or chakra embedded on the idol itself but that does not mean that lord does not have four hands. Two of the upper hands are in the pose of getting hold weapons in both the hands as you can see in the picture below.No jaina idol has a pose showing four hands and with upper hands holding any kind of weapon. Lord Balaji has a unique story of why the shanka and chakra are missing. In a popular story lord presents his ardent devotee king Tondaman with his weapons to fight a war and also predicts that they will be returned by another devotee many years later. As predicted Sri Ramanujacharya presented with those weapons much later. 4. It is not true that there are no literary evidences of Tirupati being a vishnu temple. Even being a jain Tiruvalluar mentions about Vengadam. Silapathikaram mentions Lord Venkateshwara as an incarnation on Lord Vishnu. Vishnu purana also mentions Venkateshwara as the main deity of kaliyuga. Some argue that Venkateshwara mentioned by Tiruvalluar and also in Silapathikaram represent jain god. As the name suggests Eshwara means a hindu god either Shiva or Vishnu. The above facts seem i think disprove all the claims “ with respect to everyone"". All are free to visit the temple and offer their worship but not to play with other relegions beliefs with false claims. Everyone is welcome to the abode of lord. Be it Lord Neminatha or Lord Venkateshwara or Lord Buddha God is what you see and believe. Reach the abode of lord you shall find peace. Myself am a ardent devotee of Lord Venkateshwara. Even after all these confusions we cannot deny that Tirupati is one of the most famous relegious place in the world much credit goes to hindus that. “Venkatdhri samam sthanam brahmande nasthi kinchana Venkatesa samo devo na bhuto na bhavishyathi"" Meaning: There is no Shrine equal to Venkatdhri and there is no God on par with Lord Venkateshwara. “ OM NAMO VENKATESHAYA “ P.S: Pardon any mistakes and make necessary suggestions to make corrections. Healthy debates are encouraged. Thanks for reading. Edit: Changes in Lord Neminatha idol.",Surya Ram,https://www.quora.com/profile/Surya-Ram-33

Beside Arcā-vigraha (we call it Pratimā) these are the 2 forms of idols that you find in big temples in Bali which actually expresses the attributes of Godhead Himself: (1) Pelawatan or Tapaan Barong (Śiva) and Rangda (Durgā) are the efforts of Balinese elders to present Śiva-Śakti (God with His Power) on earth. These idols are usually kept in large temples in Bali such as Kahyangan Tempels and Dalem Temples.Pic: the left is Barong (Śiva) right is Rangda (Umā or Kālī) Not always these idols are shown to the public but stored in a building (Gedong) inside the temple on certain days they are shown and sometimes they come out of the temple to travel in visiting other temples.Not a few here are devotees of Barong and Rangda figures even their devotion to idols cannot be underestimated.From the theological point of view Barong and Rangda symbolizes God (Barong) with His Śakti (Rangda) but from another point of view Barong and Rangda symbolize duality: black and white good-evil knowledge-ignorance etc.2. Padmāsana and AcintyaEvery temple and house in Bali we have a building called Padmāsana. I think this is a manifestation of Mount Mandara in the episode of churning of the ocean (Samudra Manthana). If the structure of the building is complete we will find the figure of Kūrma (we call it Bedawang Nala) at the very bottom. Above the turtle (Kūrma) is the main pilar (the body of Padmāsana / Mt. Mahāmeru) wrapped around the dragon Vāsuki and Ananta.At the top of the building is place for Supreme God we call Him Acintya. Acintya corresponds to a rather recent trend towards monism in Bali according to which there is one supreme deity and that all other gods are only manifestations of Him. Acintya is beyond the mind and considered as the origin of the Universe all other divinities emanating from Him.His nakedness expresses that His consciousness is no longer carried away by His sense-faculties since He is Nirguṇa. Prayers and offerings are not made directly to Acintya but also to the other manifestations of the deity. He is often not even represented in which case He is only evoked by an empty throne on top of a pillar [the Padmāsana lit. ""lotus throne""] inside Balinese temples.[1] This Acintya is identical to the Paramaśiva (Nirguṇa Brahman) in Balinese Śaiva Siddhānta. Acintya also reminds me of the thousand-armed of Viṣṇu Nārāyaṇa who sat on a mountain top according to Śrīmad Bhāgavata Mahāpurāṇa (8:7:12).उपर्यगेन्द्रं गिरिराडिवान्य आक्रम्य हस्तेन सहस्रबाहु: । तस्थौ दिवि ब्रह्मभवेन्द्रमुख्यै- रभिष्टुवद्भ‍ि: सुमनोऽभिवृष्ट: ॥ १२ ॥Manifesting Himself with thousands of hands the Lord then appeared on the summit of Mandara Mountain like another great mountain and held Mandara Mountain with one hand. In the upper planetary systems Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva along with Indra King of heaven and other devas offered prayers to the Lord and showered flowers upon Him.P.S.

Maa Gauri is the rebirth of Maa Sati who was born to retrieve Lord Shiva as her husband and to destroy the wicked. Mother Gauri was the daughter of Daksha that's why mother Parvati is also the granddaughter of Brahma. Maa Gauri is also called Durga. It is mentioned in the Puranas that Maa Gauri and Lord Rudra were first born due to the anger of Brahma. (Markandeya Purana Canto L)Next Brahmā further created Rudra whose birth was from his soul when it was angry and Saṅkalpa and Dharma who was begotten before all the preceding sons. And those who with their sons and other relatives were first created by the Self-existent felt no attachment for the worlds but showed disregard and were composed in mind. They all knew the future they were free from passion free from envy. When they thus showed disregard at the creation of the worlds the high-souled Brahmā grew very wrathful; then was produced there a male like to the sun possessed of an immense body the body being half man’s and half woman’s. “Divide thyself” said the god and then disappeared.Lord Rudra and Mata Gauri were born in the form of Ardhanaresvara from the anger of Lord Brahma. Skanda Purana Kedāra-khanda (Chapter 20)Thus his queen was made to comply by the Mountain. Then the lucky Menā conceived a girl in her womb. She was the great Vidyā the great Māyā the embodiment of the highest intellect. She was Ambā the great daughter of Dakṣa Rudrakālī Satī. The chaste lady of beautiful eyes and excellent fortune Menā bore in her womb that highest glory of large eyes. Then Devas sages Yaksas and Kinnaras eulogized Menā of excessive fortune and the Mountain Himavān. In the meantime their daughter named Girijā was born. When the goddess the bestower of happiness on all manifested herself divine drums were sounded; celestial damsels danced; lords of Gandharvas sang; Siddhas and Cāraṇas eulogized (her); Devas showered plenty of flowers. Then everything the entire unit of the three worlds became delighted. When the great Satī Girijā incarnated herself Daityas became excessively frightened. The groups of Devas the great Sages Cāraṇas and the groups of Siddhas attained great joy.Mother Gauri was Sati in her previous birth and Mother Sati was the daughter of Daksha but Mother Gauri is the rebirth of Sati who was the daughter of Mena and Himavān.Note: Maa Gauri is the main goddess in Shaktism and Shaivism and it is believed that Maa Gauri is the source of all gods and goddesses but the truth is that Uma is also a form of the same Supreme Goddess Lakshmi so there is no difference between Lakshmi Saraswati and Uma.

And also chaos and adharma slowly started creeping into King Parikshit's reign. Pandavas and Panchali (or Draupadi) decided to climb the Himalayas as a final penance/yatra (sort of) to reach heaven. They climbed the Himalayas and were accompanied by a dog (Lord Yama in disguise). As they climbed/walked their way to the top one by one they started falling and dying and ending up in hell. Apparently the reason for their deaths is because of their desires issues and troubles caused by them and their own pride. Panchali falls first possibly because of her pride and she favoured Arjuna more among her pandava husbands. (she had a soft corner for him.). Sahadev and Nakul fall next possibly because they were prideful about their looks Arjuna dies next because he was prideful about his archery skills. Bheem dies last because many a times during the forest exiles of the Pandavas he was inconsiderate about food. He used to eat a lot without leaving anything for others thereby starving them. So they used to share the food among themselves before letting him to eat. Yudhistir who did not take pride in anything (except for his pride on following righteousness) nor was biased to anyone and the dog finally reached the top of the himalayas. The dog revealed it's true Identity to be Lord Yama. Lord Yama takes him to hell first and makes him stay there for 1 day stating that a steady headed dharmaraj such as Yudhistir should also have the experience of knowing what is hell like. Yudhistir was later taken to heaven and was promised that Panchali and his brothers will join him shortly as they they get the experience (of punishment) of hell. On Earth Parikshit was ruling his empire in a noble way and a son named Janemejaya was born to him. He crowned him the Crown Prince of Kuru Dynasty. Once Parikshit was adventuring into a forest he met a Demon named Kali. This demon requested him to grant permission to enter kingdom and later the world. He also added that Kali Yuga should start as per the laws of nature and in this yuga righteousness and noble qualities will degrade and the world will be thrown into imbalance. King Parikshit refused and said that as long as he lived he will not allow Kali to occupy this kingdom and this world. Since Parikshit was as mighty as Pandavas (May be more than them it depends on sources) Demon Kali requested for a negotiation. After a long negotiation Kali got the permission to reside in 5 places in the world. (Places where (Not in order) 1. Prostitution happens 2. Animals are slaughtered 3. People gamble with wealth and property 4. People consume Alcohol and other drinks 5. Where Gold exists. On some sense these 5 are great sources of evil even today). By his permission to reside in places where gold exists Kali went to reside in the crown of Parikshit and started to control and corrupt Parikshit's head. Under the influence of Kali he in his mentally deranged condition took a dead snake made it similar to a garland and put it on the neck of a Rishi (Don't know his name) and went away. The Rishi was insulted and on seeing this act the Rishi's son (who apparently is an immature (spiritually and righteously) adolescent or at the maximum a guy in his 20's or 30's) gave a curse to Parikshit that he will die by a serpent bite within 7 (in some sources 10) days. But the Rishi was sad and surprised because of two things. How did such a young immature lad get to power to grant such devastating curses? (Usually in Dwapara Treta and Satya Yuga only a reasonably old mature and aesthetically strong people who have followed righteousness firmly and/or did great penances like Rishi's Great Gurus Exceptionally powerful and Kings or people in their extreme anger who have suffered a great and terrible loss such as having a member of their family killed have the power to grant such curses ). Second Laws of judgement/punishment/dharma is failing. (As per the Rishi's opinion this is not a great sin that can be punished with death curse). The implicit message is that people have started to get very great powers and are capable of misusing them very easily. Moral values will fade and materialistic things will gain more importance than the righteous things. As per the curse Parkishit was bitten by a snake and died. (Some sources say that this snake was actually the serpent king Takshak who sworn to kill Arjuna or his lineage because he captured Khandivaprastha by burning down the magical forest occupied by the snakes. Later the Pandavas with the aid of Lord Krishna and Lord Indra transformed Khandivaprastha into the grand city Indraprastha ( present day New Delhi or atleast close to it.) which was supposed to be more glorious and economically prosperous than Hastinapur.) And as soon as Parikshit died Kali Yuga prevailed in full dominance. Parikshit was so mighty that he was able to delay the onset of Kali Yuga for 7 to 10 days. The angry crown prince Janamejaya now became the king and ordered to start a grand yaga to kill all the snakes in the world. While the yaga was in progress his fellow court people advised him that it was a grave decision and pleaded him to stop the yaga. The yaga was stopped and they all explained to him about the entire lineage of Kuru Dynasty right from the Lunar Dynasty's founder following down to King Bharat (Who united our country and gave the name ""Bharata"") King Hastin (Who founded the Hastinapur City) King Kuru (Who officially formed the alternate name Kuru Dynasty) and proceeding down to King Shantanu and all the way till present day events of Mahabharat. Janamejaya forgave and continued his reign in the foot steps of his ancestors. In due course of time the entire Kingdom of Kuru was becoming rebellious and restless with chaos and adharma. King Janamejaya did his best to restore dharma. Possibly because of Draupati's curse in Hastinapur court when she was disrobed (only to be saved by Lord Krishna) or because of some other reason the Hastinapur city was hit with a massive flood and sunk into the ground. The capital was shifted to some city (name not sure) some where south of it. In a situation of great political and economical unrest King Janamejaya was forced to wage a war against some enemy invasion. At the end of the war he was dethroned by the enemy king and possibly killed. Janamejaya had no progeny and hence the Kuru dynasty ended. After Janamejaya died the very last survivor who has some power to stop Kali is gone. On a parallel note after Kurukshetra war the Yadavas who did not take part in the war became more and more ""adharmic"" and nearly 36 years after the war some of the Yadavas after getting drunk started a fight among each other due to differences of opinion or mutual hate (It's a complicated set of reason but as far as my understanding goes it happens more or less immediately when Parikshit was corrupted by Kali). This fight became a serious one and in the process all of Lord Krishna's sons including the noble Pradyuman and several other powerful Yadavas met with their doom to such a point that the Yadava clan almost got wiped out. (Some sources say that the clan and Yadavas died completely and some say that there were a few survivors who suffered a lot and existed in Kali Yuga.) Lord Krishna and Lord Balaram did not prevent this uprising. Both of them fled to the forests and started meditating to calm themselves. While doing so a hunter who was hiding in a bush mistakenly pierces Krishna with an arrow thinking him to be a deer. Later the hunter (Who was King Baali Bother of King Sugreev of Ramayana time in his previous birth) begged for forgiveness. Krishna said that this was not his fault and ""Leaves the Earth"". Later Balram also ""Leaves the Earth"" (A white serpent came out of his mouth and it went into the sea.) This was because of Queen Gandhari's curse. At the ending of Kurukshetra war possibly on the 16th or 17th day evening of the war Queen Gandhari came to the battle field and was extremely sad and devastated to have her 99 sons (except Duryodhan) killed by Bheem. When Lord Krishna went to offer his condolences Gandhari in fury asked Lord Krishna why he did not end the war in a moment's notice though he has the power and let it proceed. It was King Dhritarastra's  fate to be born blind and having his 100 sons killed in this life time (There is a story behind this regarding a tyrant king a swan and it's 100 cygnets.)  But Gandhari did nothing in her past lives nor in her current life to receive such brutal suffering. Gandhari in her desperation and rage gave a notorious curse to Lord Krishna: To feel the pain she is facing of having her sons being killed Krishna will see the entire of his Yadava clan  die infront of his eyes and his kingdom will burn to the ashes. He and his brother will be left with no lineage to rule. All of Krishna's sons will die in a massive fight that will happen in Dwaraka. Krishna on the other hand will have no power to stop this war and will flee to the forest without any weapons. There in the forest unarmed he will be killed by a hunter and later the entire city of Dwaraka will sink into the sea. The remaining Yadavas who survive the war will be suffering a lot because of chaos and facing all the above misery. Lord Krishna though he had the power to nullify the curse wholeheartedly accepted the curse. With Lord Krishna gone and with no saviour to save the world from evil Adharma will flourish in the Kali Yuga. As per the Hindu mythology we are living in Kali Yuga. Since this is the last yuga in the current cycle of the cosmos/life decided by Brahma to cleanse the world of evil and to end Kali Yuga Lord Vishnu said that he will take the 10th avatar namely Kalki Avatar when adharma reaches the pinnacle and end the world to start a new and fresh cycle of life. Lord Parashuram one of the 7 immortals (chiranjeevi) of the Hindu mythology will be the guru for Kalki Avatar. I apologize for such a long answer. I found that this question needs a proper explanation. Different sources of Mahabharat (authors interpretations analysis etc.) have different views and different set of events leading to the common end results. I appreciate alternate sources views and explanations also. I did my best to give a detailed and proper answer but if I am wrong somewhere down the line I will correct it.",Arun Prasaad Gunasekaran,https://www.quora.com/profile/Arun-Prasaad-Gunasekaran

Today is March 4 2019 and we are celebrating Mahashivratri festival in India. I still am overwhelmed with the incident took place today noon which I am sharing with you all. Since my earliest memories on the special days like Shravan month Mondays and Mahashivratri I used to go and worship Gopeshwar Mahadev Temple which is situated at the Town Hall of Indore and only 500 meters from my residence.Temple timings for offering abhishekam to the Shivling is from 5 am till 12 in the noon. This 12 means 12 sharp! The main priest closes the doors exactly at 12 even if Prime Minister wants to perform abhishekam. My father and grandfather too are witness to this 12 pm closing rule. And even on Mahashivratri temple closes exactly at 12. I have seen throughout my life. So coming to the main point I desperately wanted to go and perform abhishekam being Mahashivratri today. But today morning was very weird for me and I got stuck up in some unavoidable and important work. 11 am crossed 11:30 am crossed and finally when I saw the clock it was showing 12:05 pm. My heart dropped and I lost all the hopes of going to the temple. Performed abhishek at home and continuously persuading my heart like that it's ok and we will go to the temple tomorrow and Shiv Ji is residing in your heart always so don't be sad and so on. And situationally at around 1:15 pm I had to visit the doctor whose two clinics are on either side from my residence. My brother insisted that we should go to his newly opened clinic. Surprisingly doctor's new clinic was on the same road where Gopeshwar Temple is situated. So we both started from home and passed by the temple. And when I offered my pranam from outside I saw 10–12 devotees going inside and performing abhishekam. I couldn't believed my eyes what I saw. I checked the watch and it was showing 1:20 pm! I parked my vehicle and we both ran towards the temple. There I saw main gate of the garbhagrih open and devotees are pouring milk/water on Shivling! That was the strangest part as why the temple not closed at 1:30 pm! But Shiv Ji is way beyond all the whys and hows! I believe it is the will of Shiv Ji to grant me darshan and abhishekam. My eyes slightly wet I washed my hands and feet entered into the garbhagrih and performed abhishekam to my heart's content.Offered my pranam many times and then resumed journey to the doctor's clinic. Things like these whenever happened with me I feel he is standing right beside me holding my hand and he will take me to his place after my role is done here.

That 10000 period began 500 years ago with the advent of Lord Krishna Himself taking the form of His own devotee Sri Krishna Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Therefore at the present time all the followers of dharma (spirituality) should spend their lives fully dedicated to the world deliverance mission of Lord Caitanya for expanding that spiritual revolution which is currently in a seed-like state into a full-fledged tidal wave which will completely spiritualize our modern day totally materialistic global society.

They all represent the same mother goddess Durga or Parvati.Paraambika Paarvati. Maa Chandika.:- For the vanishing of the demons  when devi takes ferocious avataar she is reffered to as Chandika devi. She Who has three eyes wears beautiful clothes wears a crescent moon on her head wears a well jwelled mukut rides a magnificient lion. She is ferocious yet compassionate. She has multiple hands and holds a myriad of weapons. Always ready to kill the wicked and protect the Dhaarmics. One should always remember her lotus feet.Mata Kalika/Kali:- Another ferocious avataar of devi is Maa Kali. Note that shes only ferocious and dangerous for demons. For devotees she’s the most compassionate mother. Kalika is another name for Kali Maa. She is the most highest energy according to the kalikula sect of shaktaas. She is the eternal consort of kaal or mahakaal. She is beyond the understandings of lord brahma lord vishnu and even the understanding of her own consort Mahakaal / Sadashiva.Mata Maatangi devi:- Devi matangi is one of the dasamahavidyas the ten divine devis who is the personifications of ten divine vidyas or knowledgeand no doubtly another avataar(incarnation) of devi durga or kali or parvati. She is considered as the daughter of maharishi matang. Thats why another name for durga maa is matangmuni pujita the one who is worshipped by matang muni. She is also considered as the taantric form of Devi Saraswati.Mata lalita-maha-tripurasundari Parmeshwari:- Lalitatripura sundari is the most highest most enlightened form of devi. In this avataar shes the most powerful among all the dieties. In this incarnation she is independent .She in this form can create sustain and destroy by her own. Thats why lord Sadashiva himself gets dissolved in her shree vigraha. She is Shree mata the most highest mother. She can take up the role of the supreme father as well. She is chaturbhuja sits on a magnificient throne the queen of sree nagara or manidweepam.Mata Ambika Devi:- Ambika devi is another form of devi . She was created from the kosh (cells) of the body of parvati devi  hence she is known as kaushiki. She is none other than mahasaraswati who is the personification of sattvaguna of parmeshwari para-ambika mata parashakti (parvati or lalita).she is the slayer of shumbha nishumbha  chandmund dhumralochan and Raktbeej.Maa Aadishakti:- Devi is reffered to as Aadishakti because she is the first ever energy to ever exist before anything. She existed before the creation she exist during the creation and she will always exist after the destruction of this and multi other creations. Even Aadipurush or sadashiva took form from her sree vigraha. She unite with parmeshwara and create everything. At the time of destruction she merges sadashiva  and the entire creation within herself. And thus she exist independently. But that doesnot mean she has no husband. Definitely she has. She is sumangali. She is Sada-Suhagan. Para-ambika parmeshwari.Jaya Jaya BhavaniShankar😄 ✨ -Ishan🐦,Iśān,https://www.quora.com/profile/I%C5%9B%C4%81n

Maa sita : Daughter I am Sita your mother. Me (excited) : Maa I waited so long to meet you. I am so excited that you came to meet me. But what made you come here? Maa sita : Daughter I am present everywhere in everone's heart including you 😊. Your love and devotion for me made me come here. Me : Maa people in kaliyug insult your consort ramji who fought for you but glorify ravan who abducted you for his lust and to satisfy his crave for women to whom he considered as his plaything. Maa can you please make them know the truth and tell them follow the path of truth? Maa sita (smiling) : This is kaliyug. In satyug the followers of dharma and the followers of adharma lived in different worlds. In treta yug both lived on earth in dwapar yug both lived in same family and now both are within the same person which makes them confused and they choose adharma over dharma. My shri ram is the perfect husband who never doubted my chastity and fought for me without thinking about his life. And that ravan who is glorified by my children today did touch me and never respected me. Forget me he never respected his daughter in law even nor did he pay heed to the words of his wife which led him to death. Me: I got it! But I want to ask one more question. Maa sita : Ask daughter! Me : You are mool prakriti the mother of all but your children (prajas of ayodhya) questioned your fidelity you quietly went to the forest leaving the pleasures of the royal castle. Why didn't you punish them for their mistake? Maa sita (again smiling) : That was nothing but my Leela. Me and my husband are inseparable. When I was in the valmiki ashram he was with me and when he was in ayodhya I was with him. If that Leela was mine only then why should I punish them?

As a mother I have to teach them the correct path only punishing isn't the way dear. And if the talk comes about my pleasure and comforts I never suffered at the first place because my raghunath ji was always with me and I was so happy that I had the chance to live in a pure and holy place like valmiki ashram. Me : Maa you are so great. How can I be a complete devotee of yours? Maa sita : Just one thing is needed ‘love'. This can make you a complete devotee of mine. Me: Yes maa! You are the inspiration of many. What are the duties of a daughter that I should follow? Maa sita : First of all a good daughter should respect her parents obey their commands and value them more than a god. That's your only duty. Now I have to go back to saket dham my swami shri ram is waiting for me. Bye daughter. Me : Bye maaAgain a bright light shines and she disappears.

First of all two days in a row in that temple I sat down alone with no one around closed my eyes in meditation and immediately experienced a timeless state of inner awareness with no idea of my external surroundings or how much time might be passing; indeed I had no concept of time at all. The next thing of which I was conscious was a feeling that I should ‘wake up’ so to speak. I did so and found that several hours had passed a crowd of fellow devotees was literally physically pressed up against me without my notice and a woman was tapping me (and everyone else) on the shoulder and saying it was time to go outside so the pujaris could prepare for upcoming ceremonies. Later while attending evening Arati to Vishnu in the temple during the loud and fast ringing of the bells and the waving of flames in ritual patterns before the Swayambhu Murti of Badri Narayana I saw a vision in the flickering firelight. This was a vivid apparition overriding my physical sight not something subtle. I saw faces of Vishnu - living real faces not carven or painted depictions and not just one but another and another flashing in rapid succession. A palpable energy shot up my spine like a spike the most powerfully I had ever felt. I was definitely gasping and crying mostly in a very good way though it wasn’t entirely comfortable. My vision of the faces coalesced such that I saw all the faces at once outspread in a sweeping gallery almost though they were all atop one vast body. Many of them were beautiful smiling some feminine (possibly as many as were masculine) shining with light; but many others were quite monstrous in appearance glaring fiercely (not necessarily at me but in various directions) and spitting sickly-looking fire or gnashing meat between their fangs. It felt in a way that they were more than faces that they somehow encapsulated the phenomena of the universe. That vision ended as the pujaris carried the Arati flames over to the devotees (including me) and we took blessings from them. Just as I was finishing doing so Vishnu laid His hand on my right shoulder. I’m not claiming objective reality of this; certainly the people sitting right next to me didn’t seem to see anything; but it was my experience. I felt it at least as physically as any other sensation. His hand was so hot that any more heat would’ve burned me; it felt like it should’ve scorched my clothes yet it felt extremely pleasurable. His heat spread through my body in a kind of wave like a thick steaming brothy nectar that tasted like Home. Then the pujaris performed Vishnu Sahasranama and Sahasranamavali. During that long chant (maybe half an hour or so) I actually had one of the most privately meaningful spiritual experiences of my life but I think I should keep that part to myself for now.,Devala Rees,https://www.quora.com/profile/Devala-Rees

All that existed then was void and formless: by the great power of Warmth was born that One.—Rigveda Nasadiya suktaWho really knows? Who will here proclaim it?Whence was it produced? Whence is this creation?Gods came afterwards with the creation of this universe.Who then knows whence it has arisen?Whether God's will created it or whether He was mute;Perhaps it formed itself or perhaps it did not;Only He who is its overseer in highest heaven knowsOnly He knows or perhaps He does not know.—Rigveda 10:129-6“In the beginning arose the Golden Germ: he was as soon as born the Lord of Being sustainer of the Earth and of this Heaven. What God shall we adore with our oblation?“—Yajurveda(4:1:8 31)Devi sukta (10.125) states a goddess is all the creator the created universe the feeder and the lover of the universe;""Such is his magnificence but Purusha is greater than this;all beings are a fourth of himthree-fourths -- his immortality -- lie in heaven.""""Three-fourths of Purusha ascendedthe fourth part was here again and againand diversified in form it movedto the animate and the inanimate world.""—Purusha sukta from Yajuraranayaka (3:13 33& 34):It describes this form of His as having countless heads eyes legs manifested everywhere and beyond the scope of any limited method of comprehension. All creation is but a fourth part of Him. The rest is unmanifested.Upanishads have a less meta-physical but still highly philosophical description of a cyclical world-view. Universe is series eternal and endless cycles of creation and destructions. Each rishi/rishika has their own interpretation of universe ideas varies from one upanishad to another.:Purusha and Prakriti are taken a 2 abstractions of Matter and Energy OR Man and Nature OR the Laws and Process.The Universe endures for about 4320000000 years (one day of Brahma the creator or kalpa)and is then destroyed by fire or water elements. At this point Brahma rests for one night just as long as the day. This process called pralaya (cataclysm) repeats for 100 Brahma years (311 trillion 40 billion human years) that represents Brahma's lifespan.“Oh Gargi! The earth along with those which are above and below the earth the time that is past present and future are all in unmanifested space.”—Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (3:8 4)""There no sun shines no moon nor stars nor lightning; where could there be fire? From Him who shines all things derive their light -- it is His light that illumines this entire universe.""—Mundakopanishad (2:2 10)Purana Smrities Itihaas and later texts : here the arguments are more practical and more human centered this was perhaps done to make these ideas available to common folk in the form of stories and mythologies. The idea of parallely existing Multiverse is also quite fascinating. Rise of the trinity:Brahma :Brahma start creation in what is called a Kalpa which has 4 yuga 1 Krita Yuga = 1728000 years (4 times Kali yuga) 1 Treta Yuga = 1296000 years (3 times Kali yuga) 1 Dvapara Yuga = 864000 years (2 times kali yuga) 1 Kali Yuga = 432000 years Total duration of four yugas = 4320000 years = 1 Mahayuga This is one day of brahma when he sleeps at night the and equal cycle of Destruction happens called Pralay. Brahma eventually dies leaving behind a vary long period of non-existence called Mahapralay  until new Brahma arises. VishnuVishnu lies in a dream like state on the serpent Adi-sesha Ananta who is Time without beginning or end. Ananta floats for all eternity on the waters of the Ksheer Sagar ( the ocean of Cosmic Consciousness).As if he is seeing a dream Vishnu watches Brahma create the Universe. By the act of watching his dream Vishnu sustains the Universe. When Vishnu wakes from his dream one cycle of Creation ends.Vishnu who dreams up the Universe must also now protect it. To maintain the order of Creation Vishnu becomes The Protector. He takes the form of Ishwara or GodThis form of Vishnu looks very different from the one reclining on Ananta. He is standingradiant as the sun and has four arms. In his hands he holds the Conch The Discus The Lotus and The Mace. From the Nirguna Brahman( formless energy) Vishnu thus becomes Saguna Brahman a God with forms and attributes. Vishnu is now the Supreme LordParameshwar.Shiv/ShankarThe idol of Lord Nataraja (dancing God) depicts one of his four hands up in protection while the process of perpetual creation and annihilation goes on. In his upper right hand he holds a small drum (called damaruka) which taps out the first sound in the unfolding of the universe. This drum shaped like an hour-glass denotes the connection of creative sound and time. The first sound is said to be the 'Om' (pranava). The circle of fire in which he dances depicts continuity through the phases of creation preservation incarnation destruction and deliverance.Shiva's dance is a symbol of the unity and rhythm of existence. The unending dynamic process of creation and destruction is expressed in the energetic posture of Shiva. He dances in a ring of fire that refers to the life-death process of the universe. Everything is subject to continual change as energy constantly assumes new forms in the ""play"" (lila) of creation except the god himself whose dance is immutable and absolute. The pictorial allegory of Nataraja indicates the so-called ""five acts"" of the deity: the creation of the universe its sustenance in space its final dissolution at the end of the cycle of four world ages (yugas) the concealment of the nature of the godhead and the bestowal of true knowledge.Adi Shakti is the primordial Energy""I am Adi Parashakti goddess Bhuvaneshwari. I am the owner of this universe. I am the Absolute Reality. I am dynamic in feminine form and static in masculine form. You have appeared to govern the universe through my energy. You are the masculine form of Absolute Reality while I am the feminine form of that Reality. I am beyond form beyond everything and all the powers of God are contained within me. You must know that I am the Eternal limitless energy.”The MultiverseThere are innumerable universes besides this one and although they are unlimitedly large they move about like atoms in You. Therefore You are called unlimited (Bhagavata Purana 6.16.37)Because You are unlimited neither the lords of heaven nor even You Yourself can ever reach the end of Your glories. The countless universes each enveloped in its shell are compelled by the wheel of time to wander within You like particles of dust blowing about in the sky. The śrutis following their method of eliminating everything separate from the Supreme become successful by revealing You as their final conclusion (Bhagavata Purana 10.87.41)The layers or elements covering the universes are each ten times thicker than the one before and all the universes clustered together appear like atoms in a huge combination (Bhagavata Purana 3.11.41)And who will search through the wide infinities of space to count the universes side by side each containing its Brahma its Vishnu its Shiva? Who can count the Indras in them all--those Indras side by side who reign at once in all the innumerable worlds; those others who passed away before them; or even the Indras who succeed each other in any given line ascending to godly kingship one by one and one by one passing away (Brahma Vaivarta Purana)Few quotes:“He who out of his own free will spreads out this universe like a juggler or a great yogi; this universe which is characterized by the expanse of time-space continuum and which like a sprout in a seed earlier existed in an unmanifest form and is later manifested outside; to that creator Sri Dakshinamurthy who has himself manifested as my teacher are these salutations.” —Adi SankaraThe Upanishads compare God to a spider that weaves its web out of its own body and lies at the center of it. There is general agreement that the principle and source of the universe is Brahman. The resolution of the relationship between Brahman and the universe is the central theme of Vedanta and the Upanishads. The relative standpoint is Saguna Brahman the manifestation of Brahman by the human soul viewed through the human spectacles. Nirguna Brahman is the absolute standpoint where Brahman is God as He views Himself independently. Sankara's Advaita Vedanta explains whyBrahman individual soul (Atman) and the Universe are not different. Human being in the scale of spiritual progression has dual personality. They are partly animal and partly god moving in two worlds the world of Nature and the world of Spirit. ""By eliminating all the limitations of the body mind and intellect the Self can be realized. The human being is potentially divine and can overcome the limitations.”—Swami Vivekananda""The Hindu dharma is the only one of the world's great faiths dedicated to the idea that the Cosmos itself undergoes an immense indeed an infinite number of deaths and rebirths. It is the only dharma in which time scales correspond to those of modern scientific cosmology. Its cycles run from our ordinary day and night to a day and night of Brahma 8.64 billion years long longer than the age of the Earth or the Sun and about half the time since the Big Bang."" —Carl SaganIf you are inclined towards Hindu cosmology as well as Physics please read :The Tao of Physics I cannot emphasize this enough.

Sabarimala is Lord ayyappa's abode and devotees every year follow a strict schedule over a two month period before making the visit to the temple. I personally have seen people wake up at 4 in the morning take cold water baths  refer to people as swamy inshort denouncing the worldly pleasures for a specific duration. So basically it is all a question of belief and their faith in the almighty. The perennial question is why are women not allowed in the temple? Legend says that when lord ayyappa slayed a demon she was relieved of her curse and a maiden(Malikapurathamma )appeared. She then asked him to marry her and when ayyappa rejected her proposal saying that he needs to go to sabarimala with his devotees and would come to her only once the first-time devotees stop coming to the hills she has been in a never ending wait . And women thus are not allowed in as a sign of respect to Malikapurathamma’s persistence. These are stuffs of the legends. Now the problems prevalent are lack of facilities for women  the possible public outrage that this decision may cause and some political reasons.Source-Google Images What makes this scenario interesting is the location of the temple. The temple is in the state of Kerala the most literate state of our country and a state where political affiliation holds more value than your religious credentials . It's either the communists or the RSS. And quite clearly neither are ready to concede an inch. And if the violent protests from yesterday are anything to go by  things are hardly expected to change. So is the supreme Court right or wrong? Let's break down the decision in simple terms. One  this is not any one of those gender inequality issues we come across in our daily lives. This right here is a question of belief. Women from sabarimala and staunch devotees aren't willing to enter the premises even after supreme Court decision. So yes as I said earlier it's complex. But that doesn't mean that the protests taking place there can be justified. It's lawlessness at it's peak where police are being outnumbered by these hooligans. Women who are willing to enter are being beaten media persons being thrashed and every known human boundary crossed ironically in the name of God. And then come the profit makers. Political parties are seeing it as a potential vote bank for the next elections and are actively participating in public instigation. I still don't understand how they expect us to digest the bullshit they feed us in the name of press conferences where they try convincing that they are all in it for the welfare of the people.Source- Google Images How could I not bring the media people into this. Yes the situation is complicated people are irked hooligans are vandalizing public properties and even women there . It's common sense that it is risky for a woman to be there. Forget your inclusiveness or gender bridge or whatever  it makes no sense to send female journalists on ground zero when you know you are exposing them to potential harm. Can the greed for 2–3 TRP points make them forget the basic fact that they could be risking lives of personnel there amidst all this madness? Now the female angle. Yes  whatever the reason is  denying entry or prohibiting a particular gender from a place of worship that too is baseless. Every person irrespective of gender has the right to go and pray to the deity they want to without anyone intimidating them. But the simple question I want to ask is where is this issue on the priority order? What priority order? Let me explain. Menstrual hygiene of women  patriarchy prevalent everywhere in the society (even this is an example but let me tell how this ones different)  and more recently women coming out against sexual predators and harassers in the open and getting rid of demons of their past. Amidst all these issues  I somehow wonder if the sabarimala issue is something that deserves all the attention that it has been receiving. Speaking of political motivationSource- Google Images So ending my answer I'd say  women have every right to go worship in sabarimala. But why rush knowing that people are plotting every move of theirs right now to make personal gains. Let the government make proper arrangements first  let people be addressed on the issue and let the regressive ones be told how their thinking stinks. Let us not allow people to play politics and the religion card on this topic at least. Thank you,Chinmay Kuchinad,https://www.quora.com/profile/Chinmay-Kuchinad-1

(he wanted to live a long life) PROMINENT WARRIORS KILLED BY ASHWATTHAMA IN KURUSHETRA WAR…On the 12th day of Kurushetra war Aswathamma killed King Nila of Maishmathi in a Archery duel.‘“Like a fire Nila burnt down the Kuru army. The arrows were the sparks and he was like a fire burning down dry wood. When he was burning down the soldiers Drona’s powerful son who had wished to have an encounter with him from earlier times114 smilingly addressed him. ‘O Nila! What will you gain by burning down these warriors with the rays of your arrows? Fight with me and angrily strike me with your swift arrows.’ Nila’s eyes were like the petals of lotuses. He pierced the one whose face was as beautiful as a blooming lotus and whose body was like a collection of lotuses.115 On being thus suddenly pierced Drona’s son used three sharp and broad-headed arrows to slice down the bow standard and umbrella of the enemy. Nila swiftly jumped down from his chariot and grasped a shield and a supreme sword wishing to sever like a bird116 the head of Drona’s son from his body. O unblemished one! But Drona’s son smiled. He used a broad-headed arrow to sever his head with a beautiful nose and with earrings from his body. The face was as radiant as the full moon. The eyes were like the petals of lotuses. The shoulders were elevated and he117 was tall. He was slain and fell down on the ground. At this the Pandava soldiers were distressed and became extremely anxious. Blazing in his energy Nila was killed by the son of the preceptor. Drona Parva: Chapter 1007(30)On the 14th night of Kurushetra war Ashwatthama killed Ghatorkacha’s son Anjanaparva.‘“Ghatotkacha’s son was handsome and was like a mass of collyrium. As Drona’s son advanced he checked him like a king of mountains against the wind. Anjanaparva Bhimasena’s grandson brought down a shower of arrows and he74 looked like Mount Meru with rain from a cloud pouring down on it. Ashvatthama was like Rudra Upendra75 and Indra in his valour and he was not frightened. He severed Anjanaparva’s standard with an arrow and cut down his two charioteers with two others. With three others he severed the trivenu.76 He severed his bow with one and struck his four horses with four. Deprived of his chariot he77 grasped a sword in his hand and it was decorated with golden dots. With an extremely sharp arrow he78 severed the sword into two fragments. O king! The son of Hidimba’s son quickly grasped a golden club and whirling it hurled it. However Drona’s son struck it with his arrows and made it fall down. At this Anjanaparva rose up into the sky and began to roar like a dark cloud. He showered down trees from the sky. Ghatotkacha’s son was versed in maya. But Drona’s son used arrows to strike him in the sky like the rays of the sun against clouds. He then descended and once again stationed himself on his chariot decorated with gold. Anjanaparva was as beautiful as a lofty mountain. He was clad in iron armour. But Drona’s son killed Anjanaparva the son of Bhima’s son like Maheshvara against Andhaka. Drona Parva: Ghatotkacha Vadha Parva: Chapter 1108(131)On the 14th night of Kurushetra war Ashwatthama killed many sons of Drupada and 10 sons of Kuntibhoja.There was an immensely forceful river of blood that was created by Drona’s son. Warriors lamented in loud tones. The wounds94 were the waves. That extremely terrible river flowed towards the ocean that was Yama’s eternal abode.‘“Having killed the rakshasas Drona’s son struck Hidimba’s son with his arrows. Drona’s immensely strong son was extremely angry. He again struck Vrikodara the Parshatas and the other Parthas with large numbers of iron arrows. The lord killed Suratha Drupada’s son. In that battle he again killed Shrutanjaya Suratha’s younger brother. O Indra among kings! Drona’s son slew Balanika Jayanika Jaya and Shrutaharya95 and sent them to Yama’s abode. With three other sharp arrows that were well tufted and garlanded with gold he killed the powerful Shatrunjaya and sent him to Shakra’s world. He killed Prishaghna and the insolent Chandradeva. He killed ten of Kuntibhoja’s sons with ten arrows. Drona Parva: Ghatotkacha Vadha Parva: Chapter 1109(132)On the 15th day of Kurushetra war Ashwatthama killed Pourava Chedi Prince and Malava chief Sudarshana in battle.Drona’s son used extremely sharp and yellow arrows in torrents and covered the front and the rear. The earth the sky the firmament the directions and the sub-directions were covered with these arrows which were terrible in form. He was fierce in his energy. He was like Indra in his valour. With three arrows that were released at the same time he severed the head and the two arms which were like Indra’s standard of Sudarshana who was stationed on his own chariot. He killed Pourava with a spear70 and used his arrows to shatter his chariot into fragments. With broad-headed arrows he severed his71 arms which were smeared with excellent sandalwood paste and his head from his body. The youthful and beloved prince of Chedi was like the blue lotus72 in complexion. Using supreme arrows that were like blazing flames of fire he73 laughed and pierced him dispatching him with his horses and his charioteer towards death. Having slain those two brave warriors in the battle the lord who was Drona’s son remained unvanquished and delightedly blew on his large conch shell. Drona Vadha Parva: Chapter 1148(171)On the 16th day of Kurushetra war Ashwatthama killed Pandya King Sarangadhwaja and the 6 maharathas who protected him.The head of Drona’s son was decorated with a diadem. It was decorated with supreme gems jewels and diamonds and adorned with excellent cloth garlands and pearls. It was as dazzling as the sun the moon the planets and the fire. Being severely struck198 it was shattered into fragments and fell down like a large forest when it is struck by the great Indra’s vajra or when The summit of a mountain falls down on the ground. At this he199 blazed with great rage like a king of the serpents that has been struck by the foot. He picked up fourteen arrows that were capable of killing the enemy and each of these was like Yama’s staff. With five he served the feet and trunk of the elephant and with three the king’s arms and head. With six he killed the six splendid maharathas who were following the king of Pandya. The king’s arms were long and smeared with the best of sandalwood paste. They were adorned with gold pearls gems and diamonds. Those arms of the king fell down on the ground and writhed around like serpents that had been killed by Tarkshya.200 His head possessed a face with the complexion of the full moon. His eyes were coppery red with rage and his nose was excellent. With its earrings the head fell down on the ground and was as resplendent as the moon between two Vishakhas. Karna Vadha Parva: Chapter 1164(14)On the 18th day of Kurushetra war Ashwatthama killed maharatha Suratha using his swift arrows.“O king! While all the kshatriyas looked on Bharadvaja’s maharatha son covered Sudharma with a storm of arrows. At this the Panchala maharatha Suratha attacked Drona’s son on his chariot making a sound like the roaring of clouds. He brandished his supreme bow which was firm and was capable of bearing all loads. He shot flaming arrows that were like venomous serpents. In the battle when maharatha Suratha angrily descended Drona’s son became wrathful like a snake that has been struck with a staff. His brows furrowed into three lines and he licked the corners of his mouth. He glanced at Suratha in rage and rubbed his bowstring. He shot a sharp iron arrow that was like Yama’s staff. It powerfully pierced and shattered his heart and then penetrated the ground like Shakra’s unleashed vajra. Slain by the iron arrow he fell down on the ground. It was as if an extremely large mountain top had been shattered by thunder. When that brave one was killed Drona’s powerful son supreme among rathas swiftly climbed onto his chariot.92 Shalya Vadha Parva: Chapter 1232(13)Apart from that Ashwatthama killed 1 Akshouhini sena of Ghatotkacha’s rakshasa army on the 14th night of Kurushetra war. On 15th day of Kurushetra war Ashwatthama slew 2+ Akshouhinis of Pandava army using Agneyastra and Narayanastra. Note: I m not including the massacre done by Ashwatthama on the 18th night after the end to the war because Ashwatthama was possessed by Lord Mahadeva.

The secret is found in their iconography.(Pictures courtesy Google-images) In Vishnu’s upper left hand we find a conch and in the right a flaming discus. In Shiva’s upper left hand he holds a flame and in the right an hour-glass shaped drum. The conch and the drum have the same iconographical symbolism — creation through sound (sonic cosmogony) - the universe is created through the vibration of sound and the primeval sound being OM. The flaming discus and the flame are both symbols of destruction transformation and change. So by holding these symbols in opposite hands they are expressing their mutual dependency in a dance of Cosmic projection and withdrawl. Shiva is known as Naṭarāja — the King of Dance and Vishnu is known as Raṅga-nātha - the King of the stage. M.B. Santi Parva 341:22 – 27. Narayana is the Self of Rudra it should be known from age to age. If that god of gods (Maheshvara) be worshipped then O Partha is the mighty Narayana also worshipped. I [Krishna] am the Self O Arjuna of all the worlds of all the universe. Rudra again is my Self. It is for this reason that I always adore him. If I do not adore the auspicious and boon-giving Isana nobody would then adore Me in essence. The principles I set are followed by all the worlds. Those principles should always be respected and it is there­fore that I too respect them. He who knows Rudra knows Myself and he who knows Me knows Rudra. He who follows Rudra follows Me. Rudra is Narayana. Both are one Being appearing in two different forms.

The new education policy of Lord Macaulay cut off the Indians from the Indian culture by dividing the converted and non-converted Indians into Hindu Religion and Muslim Religions Hindu was never a Religion of India the term Hindy Religion was coined by the British for divide and rule policy Lord Macaulay taught that the Vedas are religious scriptures of Hindu and ‘Aryan’ came from outside of India and killed Dravid black south Indians with the opium of religious superstition the discovery Grand Canyon an advanced Vedic Civilization in 1909 supported the Aryan invasion theory and we accepted it which is in the blood of Indians with mental slavery of Britain hence we have no pain for the so-called Religious bifurcation of India with less nationality it has pushed India in Religious fundamentalism. ‘JAMBU DWIP’ KNOWN TURTLE EYE LAND as Pangaea is the oldest where first humans came into the existence and later due to the shifting of the continents separated by different environmental conditions with different stages of mental evolution.Earth was one land mass For hundreds of millions of years all the land of Earth was joined together in one large mass or supercontinent. Scientists call it Pangaea (meaning “all lands” in Greek).d mass in India called ‘JAMBU DWIP’ or ‘Turtle Eye Land’ At the place of the Great Himalayan range there was a ‘Thesis sea’ Pangaea existed about 240 million years ago. By about 200 million years ago The collision of the Indian subcontinent and Asian continent created the Himalayan mountain range home to the world's highest mountain peaks plate tectonics which contributed to the creation of continents. The plate tectonics and Earth’s geomagnetism played a great role in the splitting of the continents a part. Pangaea existed about 240 million years ago. By about 200 million years ago this supercontinent began breaking up. Over millions of years Pangaea separated into pieces that moved away from one another. ) ..Tethys SeaAbout 225 million years ago India was a large island still situated off the Australian coast and a vast ocean (called Until 65 million years ago a great ocean the Tethys sea separated India from Asia. There were no Himalayas and no Tibetan Plateau. Continental Drift Theory Continental Drift Theory was put forward by the German scientist Alfred Wegner in 1915. According to the Continental Drift Theory The parts of the crust are capable of horizontal movement around the globe causing the continents to slowly change their positions in relation to one another with plate tectonics. The fact that South America is a mirror image of Africa is presented as proof of the continental drift theory (see the video below for an animation showing the migration of both of these continents). For hundreds of millions of years all the land of Earth was joined together in one large mass or supercontinent. Scientists call it Pangaea (meaning “all lands” in Greek). Then about 200 million years ago the land began to drift apart. It broke into two pieces and scientists have called the continent in the north Laurasia and the continent in the south Gondwanaland (named by Eduard Suess an Austrian geologist).The two large continents continued to break apart into the smaller continents that exist today. Scientists call this movement ‘continental drift.Forces responsible for the drifting of continents (According to Alfred Wegner) Indians kept a record of the beginning of the creation ‘jyotirlinga’ the beginning of the Time Era Yuga Introduction Ancient Indian History is not like the history written by western Historians and Archaeologists. They have kept records in Veda the oldest literary monument of human civilization on the earth. The creation is working as a system under the cycle of the year ‘Samvatsar Kal’ they have not mentioned their name date or year. We were unknown before birth and will be unknown after death. For whom we should write history. The rotation of the sun at its axis has given the concept of time as a great event MAHAKAL’ Jyotirlinga at Ujjain as one wheel chariot and the twelve ‘Jyotirlinga’ in India represents Twelve fellies Twelve ‘Aditya’ twelve faces of the sun with 360 days cycle of one ‘Samvatsar Kal’ under which the creation is working as a system under the cycle of six seasons. Twelve are the fellies and the wheel is single; three are the naves. What man hath understood it? Therein are set together spokes three hundred and sixty which in nowise can be loosened. Rig. 1-164-48 It has been indicated here that all the phenomena on the earth are going on under the wheel of the year. It has twelve months and three hundred and sixty days with three centers Sky the Atmosphere and the earth. It indicates the yearly cycle of the months and seasons. Under the wheel of the year nature exhibits its functions.Great Event Mahakal ‘jyotirlinga’ the beginning of the Time Era YugaKedareshwar Cave Temple is located at Harishchandragad a hill fort in the Ahmednagar district. The fort is a popular trekking location. Kedareshwar Cave Temple is much different from other temples. It is situated in a cave and also the presence of water all year round makes the temple one of the unique temples not just in Maharashtra but in India as well. A Shiva Linga ‘Jyotirlinga’ of about five feet is situated at the center of the cave. One has to wade through waist-deep and ice-cold water to reach the Shiva Linga. Though there were four pillars surrounding the Linga now there is only one pillar intact. Some believe the pillars to be symbols of yuga or time namely Satya Tretha Dwapara and the Kali Yuga. Great Event Mahakal ‘jyotirlinga’ the beginning of the Time Era Yuga Veda is the first word of a civilized person on Earth. The world is suffering from the superstition of modern development which is only halfway to touching the Vedic height of development. The modern development of science and technology has created a threat to the existence of life on the earth with global warming depletion of the ozone layer with the ‘Green House Effect’ and the threat of Nuclear war to destroy the present civilization. Vedas are not religious scriptures. Upnishads are not Veda Puranas were written to teach the original evolution of the creation in a symbolic anthropomorphic manner to preserve the Vedic knowledge with the personification of natural forces as demons and deities it has been turned into myths of mythology with a long history and fancy of the narrator. Without the full knowledge of the creation and life on the earth Vedic word symbols are like Black Buffalo’ no History No Religion nor a God is Black Era ‘Kali Yuga’ Yuga Era ( Sanskrit : युग) means ""a yoke "" (joining of two things) ""generations"" or ""a period of time"" Era such as age namely Satya Yuga Treta Yuga Dwapar Yuga and the Kali Yuga. Satya Yuga  signifies the era of the beginning of the creation all was pure no duality. Treta Yuga the evolution of the human species with three immortal and self-consciousness. Lord Ram represents immortal fundamental energy ‘Sita’ Sarasvati immortal phonon wave and Laxman immortal Electron. With the trinity of the three immortal the civilization evolved with the monkey brigade first and from the monkey the human species evolved with the conflict between the devils and demons as ‘SUR AND ASUR’ Dwapar Yuga the duality increased with the selfishness created conflict in the society. Lord Krishna has supreme fundamental energy enlightened to fight for right. Kali Yuga Black Era no ethics no God no Duty in life ignorant of the aim of life on the earth.

They structured it in a way it expresses the core essence of spirituality and existence beyond physical dimensions. What I refer to as third-eye is the level of perception of one who can perceive the life beyond physicality. Shiva is a dimension which is the core of all creation and pure nothingness (no-thingness to be exact). Thousands of years ago A man attained such phenomenal vision and capabilities over the aspects of life and creation. He didn’t even bother to share his name no one knew where he came from. So People started calling him Lord Shiva as he gave the science of life and its mechanism in a way that broke all boundaries of physicality. In Stories there are four major events when Lord Shiva opened his third-eye.

Krishna in Bhagavad Gita states:-And I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman which is the constitutional position of ultimate happiness and which is immortal imperishable and eternal.The form of Krishna or Narayana is not ordinary from. The form is eternal full of bliss and full of knowledge (Sat Chit Ananda). This is confirmed by Lord Brahma.Krishna who is known as Govinda is the Supreme Godhead. He has an eternal blissful spiritual body.Thus the body of Narayana is eternal and can be perceived by pure devotion. The current form of Narayana depicted are all revelations by pure devotees and is hence quite accurate. Some scholars argue that such portrayals are all wrong and incorrect.

But it means that He destroys evil and negativity in every living being by taking away their lust arrogance and reforms them and thus sustains dharma but when needed He takes up the task of annihilation for the welfare of the Cosmos. So God Shiva can destroy anything and even Gods. He beheaded Sun God and Killed Yama God of death and even Lord Kama the God of love and desires. When someone is troubling His devotees or causing destruction to the Universe then yes God Shiva doesn't think about anything He just puts an end to such people even though they may Gods He doesn't care.There were two great Rakshasa devotee brothers of Shiva named Mali and Sumali. One day Sun God attacked them the two brothers prayed to Shiva to rescue them from Sun God. Shiva immediately came to their rescue and in a fit of rage beheaded Sun God. Seeing His son dead Sage Kashyapa cursed God Shiva saying “ I'm so heart broken seeing my son dead I curse you that in the near future you would behead your own son”. When all the Devas requested Shiva and told Him that in the absence of Sun the World will be destroyed He calmed down and again breathed life back into Sun God.(The Raakshas Sumali had a daughter named Kaikeshi who married the sage Vishravas. Together they had several children including Ravana Kumbakarna and Vibhishana. So it's possible that if Shiva had allowed Sun God to kill Sumali Ravana might never have been born).In yet another incident Shiva killed Lord Yama the God of death and thus became Mrityunjaya. Shiva did this task when Lord Yama came to take away rhe life of a small boy named Markandeya. That boy was a great devotee of Shiva. God Shiva later gave life to Lord Yama on the request of Gods.God Shiva when was in deep meditation(Samadhi) Lord Kaama released an flower arrow in order to create lustful thoughts / desire in God Shiva but Shiva being disturbed in His meditation opens His third eye and the fire from His trinetra turns Lord Kaama into a pile of ash. Thus Shiva got the title of Manmadhaari.,Sunitha Parapatla,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sunitha-Parapatla

Mostly Priest of one sect do not know names of all gods and cannot perform worship and rituals of another sect. Eg- Priest of Vaishavism cannot perform worship of Shaiva god similarly Shakti priest cannot perform for Vaishnav god etc. About the numbers of gods we cannot say for sure. It is said that there are 33 KOTI gods and goddess. KOTI is a sanskrit word and it has different meanings. Some say KOTI means Crore (1 Crore= 10 million) so there are 330million gods others say KOTI means type so there are 33 types of gods. I don’t know who is correct.. However you may also encounter a Hindu who will give totally different meaning of the word KOTI and will claim that there is only One impersonal God and his name is Brahman. If you happen to find such Hindu then he probably is from Arya Samaj sect which is a monotheist(May be pantheistic monotheist) sect of Hinduism and their claim is that Hinduism in original form was a pure monotheist religion. If you think that a single religion cannot have such diverse view then you are not wrong. Before foreigners(Malechas) came in south-Asia Hinduism was not a single religion. Outsiders kept all south asian religion under one umbrella term Hindu because they saw we all were pantheist polytheist and idol worshipers and then probably thought we all were of one religion.

RelatedWhat is origin of lord Shiva?,https://www.quora.com/What-is-origin-of-lord-Shiva,,This question deals with 2 facets whether the questioner realized or not. First one is about Shiva himself as Sat-chit-ananda entity; that which existed when the creation is retracted into itself; giving him a name Shiva would be meaningless in that nameless formless state. Second facet is Lord Shiva as a named entity that we the earthly beings with name & form can notice and discuss about. To explain first one we need to have the basics of Advaita right. As per Vedas and Advaita as the essence of it we need to see the order of the creation.Initially there was only 1 thing or entity. I am using it “thing” or “entity” because there is no better way to talk about this in English. There is no space no time concept no creation no world nothing as you can say except that “it” or “he” existed when there is no second entity. It was endless infinite in any sense complete within itself and all capable. Vedic literature calls it the Kootastha Chaitanya or BRAHMAN or BRAHMAM.The entity decided to be multiple. As there is no other party to experience the multiplicity it decided to itself be multiple. Think of this akin to you playing both sides of Chess yourself. But when you play chess both sides there’ll always be one person (you) experiencing the game. This is where Brahmam did something that cannot be explained by anyone. It became multiple in such a way that while it feels itself in all these multiple selfs each of these self only feels about itself not about other selfs or not even about that master Self (Brahmam). This is so ironical (though this is what that exists as incomprehensible reality). The sages of ancient times did meditation for hundreds of years to decipher this mystery but all failed; hence all giving a single line answer as conclusion - “I don’t know” or “I don’t know how this is possible”. They gave a personified name for this I don’t know answer and called it MAYA. Maya also does by at least a 1000 different names in vedic literature like Mahamaya Yogamaya Para Shakti Jagadamba Adi Shakti Durga Gayathri Savitri etc. while in reality this new entity is just a hollow/proxy for Brahmam through which the single & unique Brahmam expresses as multitude to understand the concept further we have to accept the existence of Maya as autonomous. Again this is incomprehensible for us hence the Vedic scriptures direct us to consider Maya and Brahmam as a feminine & masculine aspects of the one initial thing from which emanated. Think of Brahmam as an invisible nameless shapeless masculine divine consciousness that always exists does not change at all and capable of anything. Think of Maya as an invisible nameless shapeless feminine divine energy always wanting to create more & more expand love. In vast Hindu literature (vedas and other several texts) call her the divine consort of Brahmam and the Mother of all the creation.The Maya then created 3 sets of entities.WorldParmatmaSeveral gazillion trillions of JivatmasWorld is the screen on which the play of creation would be enacted. You can consider this as the collective of what we call as nonliving things in the universe including the invisible energies that make up the world. i.e. the forces that hold the atoms together the light the sound etc all with a name & behavior. Parmatma refers to the same Brahmam but with a name shape & identity in physical world. It processes all the other attributes like infinite capability timelessness being aware he is everything he is in everything always happy always existing - but with only difference that now there is a shape/form and existence in physical world. The literature starts calling it with various names depending on what the literature is trying to achieve. So in Shivamahapuran it calls this as Ishwar/Shiva. In Bhagwatpuran or Vishnupuran its called Vishnu. In general the collective vedic literature gives 3 names of Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva while that Parmatma is performing the activities of Creation-Sustenance-Destruction activities of the world. Parmatma is well aware he is Brahmam the only entity existing and he is all World Jivatmas Maya himself. Jivatmas are us. You me and all living beings - humans and all other species included. We only feel consciousness within us. Though we should be indistinguishable from Brahmam (as he is the only thing that ever existed in reality) we tend to see a unique identity for us. This is what the Rishis exclaimed “I don’t know how this is happening” and said Maya created Jivatmas this way. So coming back to your question the 2 answers in the 2 planes it can be answered.Shiva as Sat-chit-ananda (as desiribed by Adishankaracharya in Nirvana Shatkam) is birthless. There is no origin to him as there was no one else to give origin to him and this is the answer.Shiva as we in Murtis/pictures like Nataraja Dakshinamurthy with 3 eyes snakes on throat trishul in hand is the “form”. Mahamaya is the origin of this form hence Devi Bhagavatam / Chandi Sapta Sati etc texts which put the devine mother above all say the Mahamaya created the Trimurtis (Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva) so she can be taken as Origin for Shiva.The Shivlinga worship is something that bridges 1 and 2. It is a means for us to see something physical yet get connected to the nameless shapeless Brahmam beyond the creation.,Nachi Keta,https://www.quora.com/profile/Nachi-Keta-12

Hence the name of this place is “Gurusthan”. Baba then said that the time for the 4 lamps to continue burning in Gurusthan was now over and that they should be shifted from the Gurusthan to ""Dwarkamai"" his Karmsthan where they would continue to burn as his ""DHUNI"" till the time this World exists.

For more than a century past historians foreign and Indian have been trying to' unveil the mystery of the three deities namely Jagannatha Balabhadra and Subhadra worshipped in the Puri temple. But the success they have achieved is almost negligible. All the same the traditional authorities strongly hold that Jagannatha is perhaps as old as human civilization. The antiquity of Jagannatha is so much shrouded in mystery that it may take many more years for scholars to arrive at any definite conclusion. There are a number old works in Sanskrit which sing the glories of Orissa in general and of Puri in particular. A passage is frequently quoted from the Rg Veda and explained in the light of the well-known commentary of Sayana to show that the history of Jagannatha dates back to the age of the Rig Veda itself.The Puranas (Voluminous works in Sanskrit containing accounts of ancient Indian history culture mythology philosophy religion etc.) present elaborate accounts pertaining to the origin of Jagannatha in an atmosphere of mystery and divine inspiration. Prominent among the Puranas are the Skanda Purana the Brahma Purana and the Narada Purana. Even in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata there are references to the shrine of Jagannatha. The Pandavas of the Mahabharata are believed to have come here and offered worship to Jagannatha. Some scholars hold that even Jesus Christ and Mohammed the founders of Christianity and Islam respectively also visited Puri. But the historicity of such a view is yet to be established.Historically speaking the antiquity of Jagannatha can be taken to the second century B.C.when Kharavela was the emperor of Kalinga (the ancient name of Orissa). There is the mention of one Jinasana in the historic Hatigumpha inscription of the emperor on the top of Udayagiri hills near Bhubaneswar and though it clearly speaks of a Jaina deity it is often identified with Jagannatha. But reliable materials in historical form are available from the 9th century A.D. when Sankaracarya visited Puri and founded the Govardhana Matha as the eastern dhama of India.The place where each one of the four Mathas has been established by Sankara is known by the celebrated name of dhama which literally means a sacred place. Puri is the dhama of eastern India. It is the traditional belief that a Hindu should visit these four dhamas at least once in his life and the prevailing practice is that after visiting the other three dhamas one must visit Puri dhama. The records maintained by the Pandas in the Puri temple contain reliable materials to show that for centuries past people from the whole of India have been visiting Puri in course of their pilgrimage.The main temple in Puri is surrounded by about 30 temples small and big a list of which may be seen in Chapter 8. They were Put up at different periods of history by different periods. Even to this day the pilgrims are generally advised by the Pandas to visit and offer worship in almost all these temples before they are taken to the Jagamohana or the porch to see the presiding deities in the sanctum sanctorum.Jagannatha is not the only deity worshipped in the temple though it is known as the 'Jagannatha  Temple'. But along with Jagannatha two others namely Balabhadra and Subhadra are also worshipped here. These three constitute the basic and fundamental Trinity and are considered to be the forms and manifestations of the omni-present omni-scient and omni-potent supreme power.Sudarsan who is supposed to be the fourth important divine manifestation is also worshipped with the celebrated trio and these four are known as the Caturdha murti or the four-fold divine images.Besides Madhava a replica of Jagannatha Sridevi and Bhudevi are also installed in the sanctum sanctorum and worshipped.

Islam emphasizes submission to Allah and following his laws as outlined in the Quran while Sanatana Dharma focuses on living a life of dharma (righteousness) through adherence to certain principles such as ahimsa (non-violence) satya (truthfulness) and tapasya (self-discipline). The two religions also differ significantly when it comes to their views on gender roles; Islam generally prescribes more traditional roles for men and women than does Sanatana Dharma.

When Lord Vāsudeva the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears in their hearts in His transcendental form of goodness the remaining citizens will abundantly repopulate the earth. When the Supreme Lord has appeared on earth as Kalki the maintainer of religion Satya-yuga will begin and human society will bring forth progeny in the mode of goodness. When the moon the sun and Bṛhaspatī are together in the constellation Karkaṭa and all three enter simultaneously into the lunar mansion Puṣyā — at that exact moment the age of Satya or Kṛta will begin.[1]The world will still exist even when majority of people are killed by Lord Kalki. Destruction of universe does not happen at the end of Kaliyuga. It is going to occur at the end of a day in Brahmaloka. One cycle of all four Yugas is called as Mahayuga or Chaturyuga and 1000 Mahayugas make up one Kalpa. One Kalpa is just 1 day in Brahmaloka. After the day ends Lord Brahma goes to sleep and then the Pralaya or night of Brahma commences. The Pralaya which is of equal length to a Kalpa is the time period when the entire three worlds are destroyed by fire emanating from the mouth of Lord Vishnu's serpent Adisesha. Here is how it's described in the Srimad Bhagavatam:When the night of Brahmā ensues all the three worlds are out of sight and the sun and the moon are without glare just as in the due course of an ordinary night. The devastation takes place due to the fire emanating from the mouth of Saṅkarṣaṇa[Ananta] and thus great sages like Bhṛgu and other inhabitants of Maharloka transport themselves to Janaloka being distressed by the warmth of the blazing fire which rages through the three worlds below. At the beginning of the devastation all the seas overflow and hurricane winds blow very violently. Thus the waves of the seas become ferocious and in no time at all the three worlds are full of water. The Supreme Lord [Vishnu] lies down in the water on the seat of Ananta with His eyes closed and the inhabitants of Janaloka offer unto the Lord their glorious prayers with folded hands[2]This annihilation is overseen by Shiva who engages in his cosmic Tandava in order to direct all this destruction. After the end of second half of the Kalpa (night time in Brahmaloka) Lord Brahma wakes up and starts creating the three worlds again which is a mark of new Kalpa.Image(s) courtesy : PinterestFootnotes[1] CHAPTER TWO[2] CHAPTER ELEVEN,Bhanu Kiran,https://www.quora.com/profile/Bhanu-Kiran-44

On the List of notable chairs of faith in India May Be your mythical Karni Mata Temple at Bikaner. The temple has been devoted to Karni Mata which the natives believe is Goddess Durga's incarnation the protecting Mother Goddess from the Hindu faith. Karni Mata has been a warrior blossom from your Charan caste that dwelt in the fourteenth century. Having obtained requests from your Maharajas of Jodhpur and Bikaner she laid the base stones of their Mehrangarh along with Bikaner Fortin. Even though you will find several temples devoted to her this temple at the city of Deshnoke in a period of thirty km from Bikaner could now be most famous.

These critters appear outside fractures from the walls and flooring and regularly passing across the people and devotees' feet. Possessing food things that were nibbled by those rats is considered a sacred clinic. People from various areas of India and overseas have come to watch such an astonishing scene and bring milk candy along with other offers to all these sacred creatures. Outside of every one of the rodents whitened worms have been kept particularly holy while they're thought to become the most incarnations of both Karni Mata along their sons. Visitors add tremendous attempts to attract out them regularly during supplying candy. But killing or damaging a rat by mistake can be a severe sin inside this temple.

This knowledge is eternally existent but doesn't manifest. Even if it manifests sometimes it is devoid of any awe and reverence. Mother Yashoda’s love is so intense and sweet that it completely overpowers Aishwarya Jnana (knowledge of the Lord’s glories). This is the act of Yoga-Maya (spiritual potency of the Lord). Mother Yashoda’s love is the pinnacle of devotion. Neither the great sages nor the experts of Vedanta can attain such a pinnacle of devotion. In this regard Srimad Bhagavatam states as followstrayyā copaniṣadbhiś ca sāṅkhya-yogaiś ca sātvataiḥupagīyamāna-māhātmyaṁ hariṁ sāmanyatātmajam ‘’The glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are studied through the three Vedas the Upaniṣads the literature of Sāṅkhya-yoga and other Vaiṣṇava literature yet mother Yaśodā considered that Supreme Person her ordinary child.’’- Srimad Bhagavatam 10.8.45 nemaṁ viriñco na bhavo na śrīr apy aṅga-saṁśrayāprasādaṁ lebhire gopī yat tat prāpa vimuktidāt ‘’Neither Lord Brahmā nor Lord Śiva nor even the goddess of fortune who is always the better half of the Supreme Lord can obtain from the Supreme Personality of Godhead the deliverer from this material world such mercy as received by mother Yaśodā.’’- Srimad Bhagavatam 10.9.20One may ask how such great fortune was received by Mother Yashoda. It is thus explained as followsnāyaṁ sukhāpo bhagavān dehināṁ gopikā-sutaḥjñānināṁ cātma-bhūtānāṁ yathā bhaktimatām iha ‘’The Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa the son of mother Yaśodā is accessible to devotees engaged in spontaneous loving service but He is not as easily accessible to mental speculators (jnanis) to those striving for self-realization by severe austerities and penances (yogis) or to those who consider the body the same as the self (materialists).’’- Srimad Bhagavatam 10.9.21This basically establishes that Lord Krishna can only be attained by Pure Bhakti. Again only the Bhakti devoid of Aishwarya jnana (glories of Lord’s divinity) can control Krishna. This is the epitome of Premamayi Bhakti which is found among the inhabitants of Vrindavana.

The cosmic divine energy called Shakti has its existence because of you (i.e. you are an embodiment of that energy as the cosmic Goddess) and your glory and radiance is as pure brilliant and shining as the splendour of the Sun.” [Reference : Canto 25 Adbudh Ramayana]Further Shri Ram said :“You are the Lord and unquestioned mistress of the realm (i.e. the entire creation). You remain in eternal and perpetual bliss which is everlasting. You hold an excellent trident in your hand. You embody all the Gods ; you are a personification of all the Gods as well as the supreme transcendental sublime and subtle Lord (called Brahm) who is the Lord of all Gods.” [Reference : Canto 25 Adbudh Ramayana]She assumed the Terrific Mahakali form to Slay the Extremely powerful demon called sahastravan the one who conquered not only the earth but also The heavens. As per Sri Ramcharitmanas She is the source of the Tridevis :As per Sri Sita upanishad/Adhyatma Ramayana /Adbudh Ramayana/Sri Ramcharitmanas She is the divine cosmic energy herself The energy of “Brahma” ( which is Shri Ram himself) and is the mool prakriti :Prajapati replied “Sita is a truthful manifestation of the divine cosmic dynamic energy of the supreme Brahm which is known as ‘Shakti’. Being the primary cause of creation and its manifestation as Nature she is called the ‘Mool Prakriti’ or the root from which this vast tree representing the multifaceted creation has not only sprouted forth but is also nourished by and empowered to develop into its fascinating colourful and enthralling form. Since the primary cosmic divinity called Pranav or Brahm represented by the ethereal monosyllabic Mantra OM is the basic foundation or seed from which Nature itself has emerged Sita is also synonymous with this Pranav which in turn represents the supreme transcendental and enigmatic Brahm.” [Reference : Sri Sita Upanishad Verse number 2]In Sri Hanuman geeta (a discourse By Her To God Hanuman) She says :""I am not outside him. His existence is not possible without me. I am his eternal power. Appearance of this phenomenal world is my luxury my pleasure. Millions and billions of cosmic universes emanate from me. I am the giver of birth and all creation the preserver and the nourisher of all good creation and destroyer of karma existence and worn out life in them all. The appearance of this mundane world is a vibration in power. And that power I am as well as the very vibrations themselves. And I am the power of this Sri Rama. Completely non-different from him. ""Imposed by me upon this Lord of my heart the Truth consciousness and bliss reflect back upon me and I shine as sandhini samvit and lhadini. Again these are potencies of the Lord of mine. Through vibrations of these reflections I introduce the transcendental worlds of Saketa Goloka Vaikuntha and so on. When the rays of their dazzle travel far below enveloped by my gross power they transform as satva rajas and tamas. From these comes forth the world. Thus the entire visible imaginable conceivable world is my sporty adventure.” [Reference : Sri Hanuman geeta]Here “His” refers to Shri Ram i.e the one who is the eternal Brahma The eternal Parambrahma and she herself is his power. She is the one Who powers all the Realms of the Gods including Saketa Goloka Vaikuntha Swarga etc And She is the one who is responsible for Destruction Creation and nourshing the universe alongside Shri Ram. Further :""This ever-changing phenomenal flux is the Mahakali form of Empress Sita. The world is the empire of death. Change is the process of death.” [Sri Hanuman geeta]sri Hanumanji wrote :“I make salutation to Sītā who is the ātmavidyā (the secret knowledge of the self and the self of self) who has three-fold-manifestations (Shri-Bhu-neela) who is (has taken form of) UmA (Parvati). Oh Śrī Sītā the dearest consort of Śrī Rāmachandra the divine-mother (origin and the cause) of entire cosmos the most beautiful ONE whose beauty can't be expressed in words I always worship You in my heart!” [Reference : sri Hanuman stuti]as per Laxmi tantra :She is the Ultimate refugee She is the Object of the Vedas and She is the Protector Of the Three worlds. Countless creations emerge from her womb only. From Sri Sita Sahasranam strotam She has been referred to as “Mahamaheswari” i.e the Supreme Mother Goddess which itself Makes her The source of All other shaktis. Further She is also called as “Manojawa” or the divine consort of Lord Vishnu (Goddess laxmi) and even as the one who Took the form of Consorts of Lord Shiva and Lord Brahama. She is also called “mahashaktiramanomai” i.e the great super power of creation possessing stupendous and unprecedented powerful energy the matchless authority that has effective punch and strength to do anything. As per Adhyatma Ramayana she is the controller of everything the Mool prakriti :“And you must recognise me (Sita) as the pristine sublime ‘Nature’(essential element and cosmic infinite creative energy) behind creation sustenance and annihilation. Indeed I create this delusionary world in conjunction with him (Sri Ram) without any let-up or indolence(i.e. I do it diligently and constantly) (34). Inspite of it the stupid and ignorant people charge him (i.e. allege him) of being the creator of this creation of mine which I have done myself by simply being near to him. So his taking birth in Ayodhya in the most pure clan of Raghu  then helping sage Vishawamitra by protecting his fire sacrifice liberating Ahilya from her curse and breaking the bow of Lord Shiva were all due to my influence or wish.” [Reference : Adhytama Ramayana]सत्क्रिया गिरिजा नित्यशुद्धा पुष्पनिरन्तरा । दुर्गा कात्यायनी चण्डी चर्चिका शान्तविग्रहा ६०० ॥ ९६ ॥ कल्याणी कमला रामा पञ्चभूतवरप्रदा । वाच्या वरेश्वरी नन्द्या दुर्जया ६३० दुरतिक्रमा ॥ १०० ॥ [sri Sita saharanam strotam] She is Goddess Durga She is Goddess katyani She is Goddess chandi and She is Goddess charchika She is kamla (Goddess laxmi) She is Kalyani and she is Goddess saraswati.

The account of the Hayagriva avatar of Shri Vishnu is found in the Moksha Dharma Parva of Mahabharata. At the beginning of creation Shri Hari placed two drops of water invested with excellent qualities on the petals of the lotus that had sprouted from his navel. By his instructions those two drops turned into two fearsome demons namely Madhu and Kaitabha. They wandered within the stalk of the flower and found Lord Brahma designing the initial forms of the Vedas. Those demons violently stole the Vedas and went to the nether regions.On Narayana’s instructions Madhu based on tamas qualities was generated from this. The other drop was hard and Kaitabha based on rajas qualities was generated from this. With the qualities of tamas and rajas these two superior ones advanced. They were powerful and held clubs in their hands. They roamed around inside the stalk of the lotus. Inside the lotus they saw the infinitely radiant Brahma. He was engaged in creating the first forms of the four beautiful Vedas. The supreme asuras saw the forms of the Vedas. While Brahma looked on they violently seized the Vedas. Having seized the eternal Vedas the best among the danavas quickly entered the nether regions inside the waters of the great ocean.Helpless Lord Brahma having resorted the shelter of Sriman Narayana asked him for help. Then Lord Vishnu assumed a second form having the head of a horse known as Hayashira. He went to the nether regions and pronounced the sacred syllable OM which reverberated the entire region. Madhu and Kaitabha leaving the Vedas isolated went out to find the origin of the sound. In the meantime Lord Hayashira took the Vedas and returned them back to Brahma.The god who was the lord of the universe disappeared and penetrated the nether regions. Having entered the water he resorted to supreme yoga. Using accomplished techniques of pronunciation he uttered the syllable ‘Om’. This sound was pleasant in every way and echoed everywhere. It possessed all the beneficial qualities and reverberated in the nether regions. Having decided to come back for the Vedas the asuras flung them down into the nether regions and swiftly proceeded to the spot where the sound was coming from. O king! Meanwhile Hari the god who was in the form of Hayashira picked up all the Vedas from the nether regions. He gave them back to Brahma and assumed his natural form again.The two demons having found the Vedas missing came out of the great ocean and saw the great Purusha asleep on the serpent. The Lord realized that they wanted to fight with him. The very next moment a fierce fight took place wherein Sriman Narayana killed Madhu and Kaitabha.Purushottama quickly killed the ones who had stolen the Vedas and dispelled Brahma’s grief. Brahma was again revered and surrounded by the Vedas that had been stolen. Without any sense of ownership he created the worlds with their mobile and immobile objects. He gave the grandfather the powerful intelligence required for the creation of the worlds. Having given this to the god Hari went away. It is thus that Hari assumed the form of Hayashira and killed the two danavas. He assumed that form so that the dharma of pravritti could be propagated again.Reference: The Critical Edition of Mahabharata Moksha Dharma Parva Chapter 1663(335)Image credits: PinterestHare Krishna!,Debashis,https://www.quora.com/profile/Debashis-43

I befriended many people. Most of my close friends were Brahmins. This changed my life for eternity. I saw Hinduism from them. They never feared God. They worshipped instead. They prayed because they wanted to not because they were forced to. They followed a set of principles that were formed by morals and virtuousness not out of fear. Many never had a consciousness about their religion. It was a freedom they had. They just lived with it. All these were new to me. I was a Muslim until then. And then I left Islam.

Once Hiranyakashipu heard about this boon he got furious as they had approached another God (Brahma) whereas he considered himself (Hiranyakashipu) to be the ""only one who can be called God"". So he cursed them that they would get killed by their own father...  Now roll forward to the time of Kamsa... Kaalanemi was reborn as Kamsa. The 6 children of Kaalanemi were the first 6 children of Devaki. Kamsa killed those 6 children thus fulfilling the curse of Hiranyakashipu. As a side note: Why would Kamsa decide to kill the first 6 children while the as'areeri (divine voice) only warned him of his death by their 8th child? In fact Kamsa wanted to let Devaki's all but 8th child live. It was Sage Narada who changed Kamsa's mind by asking him ""how he would be sure which one of them were Devaki's 8th child""! Thus Kamsa ended up killing the first 6 children of Devaki while 7th garbha (Balarama) was faked to have got aborted (and transferred to Rohini) and the 8th child (Krishna) was stealthily taken to Brindavan.

Several processes happen during Kumbabishekam like  * During the construction of the temple a copper plate is placed beneath from the dwajasthabam to garbhagrham which acts as a conductor. * While installing the kalasams varagu arisi (Don millets) are filled in the kalasam which is generally made up of panchalokha(an alloy of five metals) or copper or silver or gold. This millet has a capacity of withstanding high electrical energy and helps in preventing the gopuram from lightning strike. * Precious gems and stones in Navaratna are placed beneath the moola vigraha before the deity is installed. These gems emits positive vibrations and suppresses negative energy. * During the installation of deity no artificial bonding agents like cement or mud are not used instead a mixture of several medicinal herbs are boiled and a marunthu (literally means medicine) is used and the process is called rakshabandanam. * During Kumbabishekam a temporary kalasam is depicted as the deity.

When the universe undergoes dissolution Brahma attains liberation. Since Brahma is most of the time a living entity (jiva) who has been appointed by Lord Vishnu to carry out the secondary creation (visarga) of the material world he is bound by his duties to assist Lord in administrative functions of the universe. Thus Lord Brahma obtains liberation only after the end of the lifespan of the universe. Since he finally attains liberation he is said to have a lifespan. Now coming to the lifespan of Lord Shiva this is a bit complicated for Lord Shiva’s expansions operate at different levels. Let me attempt to explain this concisely based on the understanding of various scriptures and commentaries of our various acharyas. Lord Sankara who is situated in the material world in mount Kailash is generally not a living entity or a jiva though some of his other Rudra expansions could be jivas and thus have lifespans. The form of Lord Sankara is not an immediate or personal expansion of Lord Vishnu such as Lord Varaha Matsya etc but is considered a separated expansion of Lord Vishnu. He is different from both jiva tattva and Vishnu tattva and has his own category known as Siva-tattva. Lord Sankara has a lifespan in the sense that he executes his duties of destruction as appointed by Lord Vishnu for the particular duration of the universe but there is no question of liberation for him unlike Lord Brahma who is a jiva. He only becomes unmanifest. At the end of the Maha-Kalpa Lord Sankara only merges back in his original form of Lord Sambhu who is situated in Mahesha Dhama outside the material world. When the new cycle of universal creation begins Lord Sankara again manifests through the glance of Maha-Vishnu from Lord Sambhu via Garbhodakaśāyī Vishnu and again resumes his duties through his various Rudra expansions. The duration of the manifestation of Lord Sambhu who is considered the divine halo of Lord Maha-Vishnu is equivalent to the duration of the one wink of Lord Maha-Vishnu during which hundred universal durations get completed or a hundred Brahmas get liberated. Thus Lord Sambhu also has a life span in the sense of being constantly involved in the flux of universal manifestations and un-manifestations. However in its original form Lord Sambhu eternally exists in his form of Lord Sadashiva in His Sadashiva-Loka which is situated in the northeast part of Vaikuntha-Loka. This aspect of Lord Shiva has eternal manifestation and no un-manifestation thus Lord Sadashiva has no life span for He is eternal. He is non-different from Lord Maha-Vishnu and exists in the same category as Vishnu-tattva expansions. With regard to the Lord Mahavishnu He has no un-manifestation for the creation and destruction of the universes happen perpetually thus Lord Maha-Vishnu has no life span. The same applies to all the avatars of the Lord. They only appear and disappear but exist eternally in their various Vaikuntha dhamas. Just to give an indication of the life span of Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva Matsya Purana 289.21–22 states‘’Hundred years of Lord Brahma is equal to one year of Lord Shiva and hundred years of Lord Shiva is equal to one wink of Lord Maha-Vishnu who is eternal. When Lord Vishnu awakes all the creations blossom and when the Lord sleeps all the creations get absorbed into the Lord Maha-Vishnu.’’Thus to summarize Brahma has a life span for he is mostly jiva and attains liberation at the end of his life span. However except few Rudra expansions Lord Sankara and Lord Sambhu although not a jiva-tattva (Siva-tattva) has a life span in the sense of becoming manifest and unmanifest in relation to the universal affairs. However Lord Sadashiva has no life span for He eternally remains manifested in Vaikuntha Dhama. Finally Lord Vishnu also has no life span for He is eternal.

I am someone who appreciates concise translation more than expounding. I find a small volume much more friendly. Even though Prabhupada supplies a simple translation the commentary adds so much length and takes a long time to get through. Also one cannot help but to notice that Prabhupada pays much more attention to Bhakti Yoga than the other forms of yoga Krishna speaks of. It is very evident and structured by Prabhupada’s commentary that he wants to take you to bhakti yoga undermine dhyana yoga because it is not for this age he says and also undermine sankhya yoga and jnana yoga despite Krishna speaking all of them. Krishna is showing yoga from many aspects not just Bhakti but with Prabhupada it seems he is always leading us to the conclusion that we need to do nama kirtana and that hare krishna is the only option because it is the best mantra according to the upanishad he quotes. Yet the Vedas and yoga offer many different paths as Krishna mentions and they are suited towards different temperaments. Prabhupada doesn’t want to acknowledge this but wants everyone chanting Hare Krishna. This was his mission. In my personal experience chanting Hare Krishna is fine and has its effects but I prefer other practices and I see myself benefiting from them more because they are more for my temperament. I find Prabhupada’s vision too narrow. I have great respect for him though he taught me a lot about Bhakti but I felt in the end his way was too narrow and I embrace the Gita on a more broad interpretation. And I do not reject Krishna as the personality of Godhead. But I simply think there is more to it. If you get into with the Iskcon people their attitude practically speaking is to exalt the traditions of their particular Gaudiya Vaishnavism above all else. If I had a greater penchant to worshipping the Lord in the form of Krishna and performing Bhakti yoga in the manner that they do then I would follow them but I have taken the path of Jesus Christ I read the Gita and follow Bhakti yoga in my own way that does not involve nama kirtana in the way they do it. I also find the lack of proper succession in leadership a big flaw in the ISKCON movement. They have done a great good though in spreading the enthusiasm of the Lord through the Gita and Nama kirtana it was part of my spiritual evolution.,Marcus Rodriguez-Tenes,https://www.quora.com/profile/Marcus-Rodriguez-Tenes

Why is Lord Rama said to be very patient even though he himself failed to preserve his own patience with Lord Ocean within 3 days?Lord Rama tried to attack lord ocean the one whom he himself was worshiping for the past 3 days. He failed miserably to preserve his own patience. Can you still call him patient ? On the contrary we are taught to remain patient for the whole life no matter how poor the situation is.Let me tell you about some portion of the time line of Ramayana. Lord Ram was sent to Vanvaas (exile in the forest) for 14 years. Their life in forest went well for 13 years. In the last year Ravana abducted Sita. It is said that Lord Ram and Lady Sita again united after 9 months. That means after the abduction of Lady Sita she was away from Lord Ram for nine months. Now let’s see how many days were taken to build the Ram-Setu (Adam’s bridge). The duration of the battle between Ram and Ravana. The Great War started on Phalguna Krishna tritiya (3) and ended on Phalguna Amavasya (new moon day) when Ravana was killed. So the battle duration was 13 days. Subtract 13 days from 9 months. This equates to 8 months and 17 days. The peace talks and emissary took 3 days. So it becomes 8 months and 14 days. Source:- Astronomical Dating of the Ramayan Time taken to build the Ram-Setu: It is said that the bridge was 100 yojanas (ancient Indian unit of measuring distances) long.14 yojanas were constructed on the first dayNext 20 yojanas were built on the 2nd dayOn 3rs day 21 yojanas were built.22 yojanas were covered on the fourth dayRest 23 yojanas were completed on the fifth day.The above description can be found in Yuddha Kanda [22nd Sarga 66-70 Slokas of Srimad Ramayana]Subtract 5 days from 8 months and 14 days. This equates to 8 months and 9 days. Was Lord Ram really impatient? According to the question after being separated from Lady Sita Lord Ram lost his patience after 8 months and 9 days. He lost his patience because the Lord of Oceans didn’t respond to his plea. Lord Ram didn’t lose his patience. He was moved by the apathetic and the emotionless attitude of the Lord of Oceans. If Lord Ram would have been impatient then:Why did he try to attack Lord of Oceans after 3 days of worship. He had the capability of drying up the ocean. He could have dried up ocean sooner on the first day or the second day.He could have even dried up the ocean without even worshipping and requesting the Lord of Oceans. But he worshiped him as a humble person.He could have dried up the ocean instead of building a bridge. When he threatened the Lord of Oceans he came in front of Ram and requested him to build a bridge. Building a bridge needs a lot of time. If Ram would have been impatient he wouldn’t have wasted time to build a bridge and would have dried up the ocean to save time so that he could reach Sita sooner.Seems like Lord Ram didn’t lose his patience. He actually threatened the Lord of Oceans to teach him humility. He wanted to teach the Lord of Oceans to be sympathetic towards people who are in trouble.,Satyarth Routroy,https://www.quora.com/profile/Satyarth-Routroy

Beside Arcā-vigraha (we call it Pratimā) these are the 2 forms of idols that you find in big temples in Bali which actually expresses the attributes of Godhead Himself: (1) Pelawatan or Tapaan Barong (Śiva) and Rangda (Durgā) are the efforts of Balinese elders to present Śiva-Śakti (God with His Power) on earth. These idols are usually kept in large temples in Bali such as Kahyangan Tempels and Dalem Temples.Pic: the left is Barong (Śiva) right is Rangda (Umā or Kālī) Not always these idols are shown to the public but stored in a building (Gedong) inside the temple on certain days they are shown and sometimes they come out of the temple to travel in visiting other temples.Not a few here are devotees of Barong and Rangda figures even their devotion to idols cannot be underestimated.From the theological point of view Barong and Rangda symbolizes God (Barong) with His Śakti (Rangda) but from another point of view Barong and Rangda symbolize duality: black and white good-evil knowledge-ignorance etc.2. Padmāsana and AcintyaEvery temple and house in Bali we have a building called Padmāsana. I think this is a manifestation of Mount Mandara in the episode of churning of the ocean (Samudra Manthana). If the structure of the building is complete we will find the figure of Kūrma (we call it Bedawang Nala) at the very bottom. Above the turtle (Kūrma) is the main pilar (the body of Padmāsana / Mt. Mahāmeru) wrapped around the dragon Vāsuki and Ananta.At the top of the building is place for Supreme God we call Him Acintya. Acintya corresponds to a rather recent trend towards monism in Bali according to which there is one supreme deity and that all other gods are only manifestations of Him. Acintya is beyond the mind and considered as the origin of the Universe all other divinities emanating from Him.His nakedness expresses that His consciousness is no longer carried away by His sense-faculties since He is Nirguṇa. Prayers and offerings are not made directly to Acintya but also to the other manifestations of the deity. He is often not even represented in which case He is only evoked by an empty throne on top of a pillar [the Padmāsana lit. ""lotus throne""] inside Balinese temples.[1] This Acintya is identical to the Paramaśiva (Nirguṇa Brahman) in Balinese Śaiva Siddhānta. Acintya also reminds me of the thousand-armed of Viṣṇu Nārāyaṇa who sat on a mountain top according to Śrīmad Bhāgavata Mahāpurāṇa (8:7:12).उपर्यगेन्द्रं गिरिराडिवान्य आक्रम्य हस्तेन सहस्रबाहु: । तस्थौ दिवि ब्रह्मभवेन्द्रमुख्यै- रभिष्टुवद्भ‍ि: सुमनोऽभिवृष्ट: ॥ १२ ॥Manifesting Himself with thousands of hands the Lord then appeared on the summit of Mandara Mountain like another great mountain and held Mandara Mountain with one hand.

She sang “Suddhosi bhuddhosi niranjanosi…” ‘suddhosi’ means ever-pure immaculate; ‘buddhosi’ means ever-awakened illumined; ‘niranjanosi’ means spotless. So she sang “O child you are a pure soul with no real name. Your body is merely a vehicle made of the ‘pancha kosas’. Why do you cry my son when you are the blissful Atman and not the body?” She fed the child with the milk of wisdom. As she suckled the baby her thoughts were ‘you are the pure Atman’. Madalasa was herself a Self-Realized soul hence her words had great effect on the baby. As she kept illuminating her little son with spiritual knowledge through her cradle songs the son grew up with wisdom. The young prince highly dispassionate left the kingdom and moved into the forest to engage himself in severe penance. A second son was born to Madalasa who was named Subahu. Madalasa brought him up in the same way as she had her first-born. Subahu also grew into a great renunciate and left home in search of jnana. The same happened with Shatrumardan the third son. The king was deeply concerned about the way his sons were giving up the kingdom and going away into the forest. “Who will take care of the kingdom after me?’ was the constant worry of the king. He therefore told his queen to spare their fourth son for him so he could take up the reigns of the kingdom after him. With the king’s permission she chose the name for their fourth son. She named him ‘Alarka’. To this son Alarka the mother Madalasa sang songs of valor that would make a great warrior king of him and enable him to protect his kingdom and make it prosperous. In him she sowed the seed of care for others. She taught him to regard other women as his mother and to think of the Lord to destroy wicked thoughts. Thus Alarka grew up to be a righteous king and a mighty warrior. Mother Madalasa demonstrated that a mother wields great influence over the child from the start and imparts noble thoughts. She guides his life towards righteous living – be it spiritual or worldly. As mothers let us be aware of our immense responsibility in bringing up our children moulding their attitudes and behavior and most importantly rendering them spiritually strong to lead a fear-free life of love and happiness.

If you have ample time and money is not an issue for you then I will suggest looking for top-rated off-campus institutes like IITs IIITs IIMs etc. For entering these institutes you have to go through an examination and selection process. If you can pass it I will highly recommend opting for these universities and institutes. Along with these programs I will also suggest online institutes like 1stepGrow Simplilearn Upgrad Coursera etc. which are giving best data science training with structured curricula. If you are new in this field or bored with your current position and want to advance your career in data professionals with hiked salary then will suggest going for the 1stepGrow data science program which can help you achieve your dream. In this program you get live sessions lifetime access to study material career support expert guidance domain specialization additional support for non-programmers affordable fees etc are some of the perks that can help you achieve a higher edge in your career. Whereas if you are a techno person and looking for more technical training then will suggest either to go for Scaler (the cost is high but the curriculum is well designed) Simplilearn ( technical learning content but outdated projects and limited career assistance) and 1stepGrow( real-time training with live classes at affordable cost but full dedication is required in classes). Closing Statement: It is subjective to say which is the ""best"" data science program in India as it depends on an individual's specific needs and preferences. Some factors to consider when evaluating data science programs include the curriculum faculty research opportunities industry connections and job placement prospects. It is recommended to research and compare multiple programs and also consider factors such as location cost and schedule before making a final decision. Additionally it is also recommended to consider the reputation of the institution the quality of the faculty and their area of expertise and the availability of scholarships or financial aid.

In Kali-yuga also people worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead by following various regulations of the revealed scriptures. Now kindly hear of this from me.”17 Detailed description of the Kali -yuga found in the most Purāṇas sums up to the fact that in this age people are mostly sinful fallen and do not have the necessary qualification to study the original Vedas (śruti). But everyone has a right to study āgamas and vaiṣṇava-tantras therefore such an important ingredient of the worship in the age of Kali Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra is mainly mentioned in such smṛti works. That being said we still find direct references to the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra in several śruti texts. One of the most famous examples is the Kali-santaraṇa Upaniṣad (literally “Knowledge how to cross over the Kali age”) which is the only Upaniṣad that gives the entire Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra. This minor Upaniṣad is very short – its prose text usually divided into three paragraphs equals to 13 ślokas approximately. It belongs to the Kṛṣṇa-yajur-veda and is listed in the Muktikā-canon at number 103. Its summary is as follows: at the end of the Dvāpara-yuga the great sage Nārada approached Brahmā the creator of the universe and asked him how one can overcome the evil effects of the imminent Kali-yuga. In reply to his question Brahmā said that one can do so by chanting the name of Nārāyaṇa the primordial person. While asked again which exactly names should one chant Brahmā speaks to Nārada the entire Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra: hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare hare rāma hare rāma rāma rāma hare hare iti ṣoḍaśakaṁ nāmnāṁ kali-kalmaṣa-nāśanaṁ nātaḥ parataropāyaḥ sarva-vedeṣu dṛśyate18 “These sixteen names counteract the evil effects of the Kali-yuga. After searching through all the Vedic literature one cannot find a method so sublime as the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra.” In the current editions of Kali-santaraṇa Upaniṣad however this mahā-mantra has a reversed reading with the “Hare Rāma” part coming first. There has been a minor controversy regarding this which would be impossible to conclusively resolve here because to do so one must perform a hard task of collecting and collating all the available manuscripts of the upaniṣad. Nevertheless we can at least mention several opinions regarding this. The most widely known explanation of this was expressed by Kṛṣṇadāsa Bābājī (first half of the 20th century) in his book “Śrī Mahā-mantra-vyākhyāṣṭakam”19. There he argues that since in Kali-yuga Vedic process of purification does not work and even brāhmaṇas are like śūdras then not so many people are actually eligible to read śrutis (to which Kali-santaraṇa Upaniṣad belongs) and practice mantras given therein. At the same time Purāṇas tantras and āgamas refer to the mahā-mantra as starting with “Hare Kṛṣṇa.” Understanding this Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu preached the latter version of the mahā-mantra from the āgamas thus giving everyone the benefit of its chanting and at the same time respecting the rules given in the śrutis regarding the eligibility. We may never know for sure but since there is no mention of such reversion in any authoritative source and since we have plenty of evidence that mahā -mantra starts with “Hare Kṛṣṇa” as we shall see below this explanation is not completely free from doubts. At any rate Śrī Caitanya's inversion if proven or accepted would be enough at least for the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas to consider the mantra completely perfect with the “Hare Kṛṣṇa” part first. Speaking about the order of the mahā-mantra in Kali-santaraṇa Upaniṣad Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī said: “Kali-santaraṇa Upaniṣad has been published in Mumbai and Madras but because [the manuscripts of] the upaniṣad were collected from the adulterated members of the Rāmāyet-sampradāya the order of the mahā-mantra in these particular editions was reversed. But even despite being so its meaning and position cannot be reversed. Any wise person will not accept any order or reading different from the mahā-mantra and its order given by the person denoted by the holy name (nāmi) Śrī Gaurasundara who himself descended in Kali-yuga to distribute the easy process for crossing over the age of Kali (kali-santaraṇa) and attaining love of God.”20 The ancient text of the Ananta- saṁhitā clearly corroborates the śruti evidence found in the Kali-santaraṇa Upaniṣad but more it corroborates that the mahā-mantra begins with the “Hare Kṛṣṇa” part of the mantra: hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare hare rāma hare rāma rāma rāma hare hare ṣoḍaśaitāni nāmāni dvātriṁśad varṇakāni hi kalau yuge mahā-mantraḥ sammato jīvatāraṇe tārakaṁ brahma-nāmaitad brahmaṇā guruṇādinā kali-santaraṇādyāsu śrutiṣv-adhigataṁ hareḥ prāptaṁ śrī brahma-śiṣyeṇa śrī nāradena dhīmatā nāmaitad-uttamaṁ śrauta-pāramparyeṇa brahmaṇaḥ21 “All śāstras agree that the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra which is composed of sixteen names divided into thirty-two syllables is the great mantra for delivering the jīvas in Kali-yuga. The original guru Lord Brahmā received these holy names which which deliver one from material existence from Lord Hari as described in the Kali-santaraṇa Upaniṣad and other śrutis. The intelligent sage Nārada the disciple of Lord Brahmā received these highest names by the process of hearing from a spiritual authority.” Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra’s correct order is also defined in Sanat-kumāra-saṁhitā: hare kṛṣṇau dvir āvṛttau kṛṣṇa tādṛk tathā hare hare rāma tathā rāma tathā tādṛk hare punaḥ hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare hare rāma hare rāma rāma rāma hare hare22 “The words ‘Hare Kṛṣṇa’ are to be repeated twice then ‘Kṛṣṇa’ and ‘Hare’ are to be repeated separately twice. Similarly ‘Hare Rāma’ ‘Rāma’ and ‘Hare’ are also repeated twice. The mantra will thus be – Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare. (Sanat-kumāra-saṁhitā as quoted by Dhyānacandra Gosvāmī in his Gaura-Govindārcana-smaraṇa-paddhati verses 132-133). In practice however the question of order is not of primary importance since as soon as one starts chanting the mantra such differences disappear in the incessant flow of the names. This is confirmed by A.C. Bhaktivedānta Swami Prabhupāda: “Either you chant Hare Rāma or you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa it is the same. There is no difference. Sometimes they first of all place ""Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare."" And sometimes they place ""Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa..."" There is no difference. Sometimes they say ""No it should be Hare Rāma first."" Sometimes they ... ""No Hare Kṛṣṇa."" But that is not very important childish. Any... either you say Hare Rāma or Hare Kṛṣṇa the same. So this is to be done.”23 Another śruti Caitanyopaniṣad from the Atharva-veda which was published by Kedāranātha Datta (Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura) in 1887 also refers to the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā -mantra. What appears to have been a single manuscript of this Upaniṣad was sent to Kedāranātha by a devotee named Madhusūdana Dāsa from Sambalpur Odisha24. Therein Brahmā tells Pippalāda about the upcoming advent of the Supreme Lord as Śrī Caitanya who will chant the confidential mantra of his own names: sa eva mūla-mantraṁ japati harir iti kṛṣṇa iti rāma iti “He chants a mūla-mantra consisting of the names Hari Kṛṣṇa and Rāma.” (Caitanyopaniṣad 11)25. Here Brahmā clearly alludes to the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā -mantra by mentioning three names constituting it in the nominative case. And in the following verse he again alludes to it by stating the number of names in it: nāmāny aṣṭāv aṣṭa ca śobhanāni tāni nityaṁ ye japanti dhīrās te vai māyām atitaranti nānyaḥ paramaṁ mantraṁ parama-rahasyaṁ nityam āvartayati. “These two parts of eight names each are very glorious. Those wise persons who always chant them surely cross beyond the illusion of material existence. Others do not. The liberated persons always chant this supreme mantra which is very confidential.” (Caitanyopaniṣad 14)26. References to the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra from a number of Purāṇas are quoted in the post-Caitanya works. Unfortunately not all of them can be traced to the current editions of these Purāṇas. For example Dhyānacandra Gosvāmī in his paddhati (manual for mediation and worship) quotes Padma-Purāṇa: dvātriṁśad akṣaraṁ mantraṁ nāma ṣoḍaśakānvitam prajapan vaiṣṇavo nityaṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇa-sthalaṁ labhet “A vaiṣṇava who constantly chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra composed of sixteen names divided into thirty-two syllables will certainly attain the abode of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa.” (Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇāṣṭa-kālīya-līlā-smaraṇa-krāma-paddhatiḥ 161)27. Nayanānanda Ṭhākura quotes Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa in his Kṛṣṇa-bhakti-rasa-kadamba (A.D. 1730): hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare iti japtvā pramucyeta pātakā nātra saṁśayaḥ “Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare."" “Any sinful person who chants these holy names is at once liberated. There is no doubt about it."" And Agni Purāṇa: hare rāma hare rāma rāma rāma hare hare śvapaco'pi japan nityaṁ mucyate śṛnu bhārgava28: “Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare.” “O Bhārgava! If a dog eater constantly chants these holy names he will be liberated.” (Kṛṣṇa-bhakti-rasa-kadamba chapter 6). Agni Purāṇa also states: hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare raṭanti helayā vāpi te kṛtārthā na saṁśayaḥ29 “Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare.” “Whoever chants this mantra even neglectfully will attain the supreme goal of life. Of this there is no doubt.” Rādhā-hṛdaya which is of tāntrika outlook and is said to once have been a part of Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa mentions entire Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra. In the 6th chapter there is a conversation between king Vṛsabhānu and Kratu Muni. The king after performing severe penances for many years hears a celestial voice (vāk aśārīriṇī) that instructs him to take to the chanting of Hari's names. When he asks which names exactly should he chant the demigoddess sends him to a sage named Kratu who lives nearby deeply immersed in meditation. The king approaches the sage and asks him for harināma. The sage gives him harināma-mantra and at this moment Lomaharṣaṇa Sūta interrupts Vedavyāsa's narration and requests him to repeat the mantra given by Kratu to Vṛsabhānu: yat tvayā kīrtitaṁ nātha hari-nāmeti saṁjñitam mantraṁ brahma-padaṁ siddhi-karaṁ tad vada no vibho “O powerful sage! You glorified the mantra called “hari-nāma” please instruct me in this spiritual vibration that bestows all perfection.” In reply Śrī Vedavyāsa gives the following instruction: grahaṇād yasya mantrasya dehī brahma-mayo bhavet sadyaḥ pūtaḥ surā-po ‘pi sarva-siddhi-yuto bhavet tad ahaṁ te 'bhidhāsyāmi mahā-bhāgavato hy asi hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare hare rāma hare rāma rāma rāma hare hare ity aṣṭa-śatakaṁ nāmnāṁ tri-kāla-kalmaṣāpy aham nātaḥ parataropāyaḥ sarva-vedeṣu vidyate30 “I will certainly instruct you a great devotee in that mantra by which an embodied soul can be liberated and even a drunkard can quickly become purified and attain all perfection. Hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare hare rāma hare rāma rāma rāma hare hare. By chanting this mantra one hundred and eight times thrice a day destroys all sins. In all the Vedas there is no other method for achieving liberation from material bondage.” (Rādha-hṛdaya 6.52-56). In the āgamas such as the Brahma-yāmala Lord Śiva describes the mahā-mantra as follows: hariṁ vinā nāsti kiñcit pāpa-nistārakaṁ kalau tasmāl lokoddhāraṇārthaṁ hari-nāma prakāśayet sarvatra mucyate loko mahā-pāpāt kalau yuge hare-kṛṣṇa-pada-dvandvaṁ kṛṣṇeti ca pada-dvayam tathā hare-pada-dvandvaṁ hare-rāma iti dvayam tad-ante ca mahā-devi rāma rāma dvayaṁ vadet hare hare tato brūyād dhari-nāma samuddharet mahā-mantraṁ ca kṛṣṇasya sarva-pāpa-praṇāśakam31 “Without Hari there is no other way to eradicate the sins in the age of Kali. Therefore hari-nāma should be revealed in order to save the world. The people in Kali -yuga everywhere can be liberated from the greatest sins by chanting the following mantra. First one should chant two words “Hare Kṛṣṇa” twice and then two words more - “Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa.” Then one should chant two words “Hare Hare” and then twice “Hare Rāma.” In the end Mahādevī one should chant “Rāma Rāma” and then “Hare Hare.” In this way one should pronounce the mahā-mantra of Lord Kṛṣṇa which destroys all sins.” In the Rādhā-tantra from Vāsudeva-māhātmya Vāsudeva says to Tripura Devī: śṛṇu mātar mahā-māye viśva-bīja-svarūpiṇi hari-nāmno mahāmāye krāmaṁ vada sureśvari “Listen o mother personification of Mahā-māyā and the seed of the universe! Please explain to me the sequence of the mahā-mantra.” In response to this Tripurā Devī says: hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare hare rāma hare rāma rāma rāma hare hare dvātriṁśad-akṣarāṇy evaṁ kalau nāmāni sarvadā śṛṇu cchandaḥ suta-śreṣṭha hari-nāmnaḥ sadaiva hi32 “O best among sons! These thirty-two syllables save everyone in Kali-yuga. Now please hear from me about the meter of this mantra etc.” (Rādhā-tantra 2.8-10). Some of the current editions of Purāṇas also refer to the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra: īśvara uvāca— harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam hare rāma hare kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇeti maṅgalam evaṁ vadanti ye nityaṁ na hi tān bādhate kaliḥ33 Lord Śiva said: “Kali does not harass those who only chant the holy names of Hari always or the auspicious vibrations like “Hare Rāma” “Hare Kṛṣṇa” and “Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa.” (Padma Purāṇa Pātāla-khaṇḍa 80. 2-3). hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa bhakta-vatsala gopate śaraṇya bhagavan viṣṇo māṁ pāhi bahu-saṁsṛteḥ34 Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa! O Lord who is affectionate to his devotees! O one who protects cows! O my shelter! O Lord Viṣṇu! Please protect me from the various tribulations in the material existence.” (Pātāla-khaṇḍa 19.25-26 (Puruṣottama-māhātmya)). upabhujya sa-dharmātmā svairaṁ vigata-vikriyaḥ hare rāma hare kṛṣṇa japann iti jagāma ha35 That pious person free from anxiety went away while chanting “Hare Rāma Hare Kṛṣṇa.” (Padma Purāṇa Uttara-khaṇḍa 204.108)Full article by Brijbasi Prabhu at link below.

Preparations for it take longer and need a team of people well versed in this system of worship. Other than priests and experts very few have the energy or time to perform such a worship everyday. If you are really interested please approach anyone who is practicing this method of worship and ask them to teach you.

Bollywood movies are always sensitive when it comes to serious topics. But sometimes for making comedy or just to make effective scenes reference of various characters from devotion is always first choice of almost every film maker. These scenes from movies have established very wrong shades about Hinduism. 1.Recent Bollywood movie named LOVE PER SQUARE FOOT Starring Vicky kaushal had a scene in a train.A couple had a conversation about public romance and suddenly both get out of control. Coming close to her the boy casually says something and kisses her lips.He says: “ Raghukul reet sadaa chali aai Pran jaye par pappi na jaye..” You are shamelessly doing something in public. That's another topic. But what's the meaning of using this line? These two lines represents the delight of Raghukul. It is still considered as a pride about lord Rama's family. It was their swore to do anything for fulfilling their promise. And now this prominent promise comes to pappi? Why? Didn't she let you kiss without conveying this cheap dialogue? 2. You are attending a grand marriage ceremony somewhere out of your country and still you have chosen Radha for dancing. It's superb to remember your culture. But wait what did you adnoun her? Sexy?Just because you are rich modern means you are allowed to humiliate pure souls by anyway you want? This is what our future generation will respect our goddess? 3. A guy from another planet fails to recognize the difference between actual God and a similar make up character. Okay!!!But was it really essential to make this guy run through gullys houses of people and even hiding below chairs of people? Making public laugh has came up to this extent now!!! 4. A leading lady from movie Lakshmi wouldn't survive in film if she was named something else? No! Her name had to be Lakshmi.5. Making use of love story of Radha-krishna is a separate topic in Bollywood. Almost each n every movie having lord Krishna focused on this topic only. It is true that this love Story Is a beautiful part of Krishna's life but it's a part only. Lord Krishna had some another shades than this. Even whole life of Krishna has multiple angles to showcase. But we are always watching him around Raadhika and making Raas-leela!!Along with thisthere are lots of examples from Bollywood movies which portrayed Hindu culture very wrongly. If it is about entertainment it is giving wrong message to world! But if you are aware of what you are doing then it is making a way to humiliate Hinduism. Movies are the most instant way whenever it comes to reference of any character. Bollywood movie makers should definitely understand future impacts of these things!

Pashupati Nath means Lord to all animals here Lord to animals means the God to the animal instincts in us too. When we surrender to Him He will relieve us from all the gunas or qualities and dissolves us into Him. The Pashupatinath temple is one of the biggest temples of Shiva located on the banks of the Bagmati Rover in the eastern part of Kathmandu the capital city of Nepal.The temple is listed in UNESCO World Heritage Sites list.There are many temples dedicated to other Gods in the temple complex which include Vaishnav temple Ram temple from the 14 th century and Guhyeshwari temple mentioned in an 11 th century manuscript.It is regarded as the most sacred among the temples of Shiva.Kotirudra Samhita chapter 11 on the Shivlingas of the north in Shiva Purana mention this Shivlinga as the bestower of all wishes.On the important festival of Maha Shivratri the temple is flooded with nearly 1 million devotees.According to Nepal Mahatmaya and Himavatkhanda the diety here gained fame and is dated back to 400 ADThe Shakti Peetha of Mata Sati is located near to the Pashupati Nath temple.Story of Pashupati Nath ::One day Shiva and Parvathi came to Kathmandu Valley and rested by the Bagmati River while on a journey.It is believed that Shiva and Parvathi were impressed by its scenic beauty that they transformed themselves into deers and walked into the forest.Meanwhile All Gods were searching for Shiva and last found Him in deer form and they requested Shiva to return back to Khailash.After much persuading Shiva agreed to return. But since Shiva lived by the bagmati in a deer’s form He would now be known as Pashupathi nath Lord of all animals. And Shiva manifested himself into a Linga there.It is a popular belief that whoever comes here and beheld the lingam here he would never be born as an animal.It is said that the wish fulfilling Cow Kamadhenu took shelter in a cave in the near by Chandravan mountainEvery day Kamadhenu Cow went down to the place where the Lingam was sunken into the soil and poured her milk on the top of the soil.After 10000 years some people who saw this incident were surprised and they removed the soil only to see the Shivlinga. When the people touched the Lingam they disappeared into the Lingam and thus attained liberation.Thus many people started to attain moksha and this was a concern for Lord Brahma the creator.Later after few centuries a temple was constructed for the Linga. In Which year exactly the temple was constructed  still remains a controversy.Reconstruction of the temple was done again in 17 th century by Nepal King.,Sunitha Parapatla,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sunitha-Parapatla

The war stopped and when Bhism asked for something to put his head on Duryodhan was the first one to order pillows but Bhism denied.

The architecture of the temples is more than just a spiritual approach. A lot of science indulges in the construction of these temples. Sanatan Temples are the place where science meets spirituality to attain the highest knowledge to strive for eternity. Every single facet the structure created is a science that affects the visitor. Temple architecture is a highly developed science. The place perfectly holds positive energy around the people visiting them. The architecture helps visitors to indulge in meditation effortlessly.The temple floor is to let the positive energies flow through the people entering from their feet. Every aspect of a temple starting from the construction to the type of rituals followed and the presiding everything lets the cosmos flow through the veins of the visitor. In Ancient times temples were built in a certain area that had maximum positive energy visiting such a place re-energizes a person's mind body and soul. Positive energy increases the concentration of the devotee to connect with its higher self. This is one of the main reasons to visit temples every day in Sanatan culture.

Buddhism spread in India and many lower castes got converted into Buddhism because of equal treatment in Buddhism. After 5-6th century ( After Ashoka ) AD till medieval period the Hindu kings and Hindu philosophers devised ways to curb the spread of Buddhism. Many Buddhists were killed their monasteries were destroyed and there were false rumours spread against Buddhism. Also they had an ingenious plan/device to stop conversions. They propagated that Buddha was the 9th reincarnation of Vishnu thus those who were contemplating conversion would feel no need to convert into Buddhism. It was also an attempt of reconciliation between the two religions that had a history of antipathy and opposition against each other. Reference: 1. Romila Thapar's Ancient India.2.

In terms of Scandinavia in total the christianization took roughly 600-700 years from the 8th century to the 14th century although isolated areas were pagan up until the industrial revolution in the 19th century like Dalarna in northern Sweden. Likewise it is highly likely that the beliefsystem survived as a folkreligion practiced in private in most of Scandinavia. The more isolated the area the more likely but the population centers would've been effectively Christian first in Denmark since we are the landbridge to Scandinavia. It's also almost without a doubt that Scandinavian pagans were aware of Christianity already before 400AD. As the Roman emperor Constantine had christianized the empire with the edict of Milan in 313AD spreading Christianity throughout central western and southern Europe and North Germanic tribes already had trade routes throughout Europe evident by the amount of Baltic amber that has been found across the world already during the Bronze age.,Mikkel Lykholt,https://www.quora.com/profile/Mikkel-Lykholt-1

RelatedWhat is the meaning and message of Ramayana?,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-meaning-and-message-of-Ramayana,,"Both Ramayana and Mahabharatha have physical world and inner world meanings. ‘Rama’ is the ever existing pure light of Consciousness the Atman or the Self inside all of us. Dasaratha means one who can control 10 rathas (chariots) at a time. He is the one who has conquered all the ten indriyas - 5 gyanendriyas and 5 karmendriyas. Thus self-knowledge can arise (birth of Rama) only to such a person like Dasaratha. This happens in Agna Chakra (between two eyebrows the place where Hindus apply bindhi or tilak) represented by Ayodhya (Yuddha means war or conflict Ayodhya means where there is no conflict). Three three wives of Dasaratha represent the three gunas - satwa rajas and tamo (Kaushalya Sumitra and Kaikeyi). Bharatha represents body consciousness Lakshmana - will power and Satrughana represents power of action. This Rama the pure self (Purusha) does not enter into any active participation in life unless wedded to the Prakriti. The Lokamatha Sita resides as Kundalini Shakthi in every human being. She is taken out of Mother Earth by the Brahma Jnani Janaka while ploughing the land. Prakriti is the source of all material world which we see and experience. It all disappears during Samadhi (Union of Kundalini with soul at Sahasrara). Rajo guna (Kaikeyi) wants body consciousness (Bharatha) to rule. This is what most of the seekers would have experienced initially. They will all think that they are just their body and nothing else. Hence the soul is exiled to forest which is beautiful at some points (Chitrakoot and Panchavati) and dangerous later (Dandakaranya). In worldly life when we get interested in illusory materialistic pleasures (Golden deer Mareecha) we lose touch with our divine consciousness (separated from Rama). When lose our devotion (Lakshmana) also and cross codes and ethics (crossing of Lakshman Rekha) we get kidnapped and our shakthi is placed in Mooladhara chakra (Lanka). Most of us live in this state where our energy is coiled in Mooladhara chakra. To rise the kundalini we have to control our mind (Vanara sena) and get the help of Hanuman (Prana shakthi son of Vayu Wind God). The king of mind has to be changed from Vaali (representing lust) to Sugreeva (representing controlled mind). One has to cross Swadhisthana Chakra (ocean) and cross all its hurdles (like Hanuman crossed and overcame all hurdles) to reach Shathi (Sita Devi) in Ashoka van. Hanuman could have taken back Sita Devi with him but Sita Devi wanted Ram to save her. Likewise it is possible to rise Kundalini through breath control techniques but it is wiser to do it with the help of a Guru. The base chakra Mooladhara is under the control of a king with 10 head (Ravana) which are all turned outside to external world. This is the state of normal human beings who have forgotten their inner divine nature and always use their sense and action organs to connect to external world and derive transient pleasures. When the devotee keeps remembering his lord in Ashoka (‘a’ ‘sokha’ or no sorrow) state like Sita Devi the Soul (Rama) will come and rescue him/her. Ravana the rajasic tendency Kumbhakarana is the tamsic tendency and Vibhishana is the satwic tendency. After rescuing the Shakthi from these base tendencies the shakthi can reach Sahasrara and spend the remaining life time. The yogi who has self-realised will continue to live with a pseudoego (Golden Sita) for sometime as per his Karma and then become one with the Supreme Soul (Rama departing this earth). This is just one interpretation of the many ways of looking at Ramayana (Rama Ayana or the journey of Rama or the journey of the Soul). Instead of all these complex thinking and action just two syllables can help us cross the ocean of life i.e. just chanting ‘Rama’. Quoting from Kamba Ramayanam: நன்மையும் செல்வமும் நாளும் நல்குமேதிண்மையும் பாவமும் சிதைந்து தேயுமே சென்மமும் மரணமும் இன்றித் தீருமேஇம்மையே ராமா என்று இரண்டு எழுத்தினால் “Nanmayum Selvamum Naalum NallkumayThinmayum Paavamum Sidhaindhu ThaeyumaeJenmamum Maranamum Indri TheerumaeyInmayey Rama Endra Irandu Ezhuthinaal"" Meaning All the goodness and wealth will come to us; The pains and the sins will get defaced and erased; The tribulation of birth and death will get over; All just by uttering the two lettered word (in Tamil) Rama in this birth.",Raguram Ganesamoni,https://www.quora.com/profile/Raguram-Ganesamoni

RelatedWhy do shootings always happen in mosques instead of churches?,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-shootings-always-happen-in-mosques-instead-of-churches,,Actually the premise of this question is incorrect. Churches have been more subjected to shootings in Westen counttries than mosques from more diverse motives ranging from racism to simple grudges. There are more churches than mosques in the West and the greater number of shootings relative to mosques consequently result from statistics too. If anything the civility kindness and compassion of Western folks make attacks in places of worship rarer and more traumatic relative to many other places in the world. The shootings at the NZ mosques though high profile is a rarity as was the Quebec mosque shootings. The same can be said for synagogues that have been attacked. In Islamic countries there are both mosque shootings from sectarian jihadists and church shootings from jihadists.That these acts are committed by fellow Muslims shames and outrages the rest of us as it always should. Ultimately though regardless of whether church synagogue mosque gurdwala Hindu or Buddhist temples are attacked the distinction is lost on me for no matter whose places of worship is attacked the acts are heinous and murder is murder regardless of the faith of the victims or the motives of the murderer,Muhammad Zaman,https://www.quora.com/profile/Muhammad-Zaman-4

It was a close friend of his father and a general Antipater who took him before the army and made a case for his election as king. Demosthenes the Athenian orator who was known to take bribes from the Persians knew about Philip's death before the news reached Athens. He claimed to have dreamed about it.

The novel is based on Mahabharata and offers interpretations of many  of the events of the Mahabharata from a different perspective than what is more popular. The relationship between Karna and Draupadi is one of the most interesting sub-plot of the novel Karna is the quintessential tragic hero. All throughout his life he had suffered rejection. He was abandoned as a baby by his mother he was rejected by Dronacharya he was rejected by Draupadi and was denied the most coveted throne in the world although he was the rightful heir to it.   Now regarding the relationship between Draupadi and Karna it began with the sayamvar arranged during Draupadi's marriage. (For those who do not know a Sayamvar is a competition held among those men who are seeking to marry one girl of course the winner gets the chick.) There was no pre-condition given in the Sayamvar and everyone was allowed to participate and theoretically any one could win. However it was actually not so. Draupadi was the daughter of King Dhrupad who was defeated in a war by Dronacharya with the help of Arjuna. To rub salt to his wounds Drona also took half of his kingdom to humiliate him. Dhrupad had since nurtured a deep grudge against Drona and wanted revenge. He arranged for a Yajna (Its an elaborate prayer) and asked from God to give him something or someone who can defeat Drona and bring back his honor. From the holy fire of the Yajna emerged this stunningly beautiful girl who was named Krishnaa (not to be confused with Sri Krishna.)  and a boy named Dhristadyumna. The Gods told Dhrupad that these two siblings will avenge his humiliation and asked him to raise them as his own children. Dhristadyumna will later play his part and kill Drona in the battle of Kurukshetra but Krishnaa's role was much more subtle. She knowingly and unknowingly played out her destiny. She would later go on to become the main reason for the great war between the Pandavas and the Kauravas. It is as if her life was pre-programmed.  This girl was also named Draupadi.  However Dhrupad soon realized that as long as Arjuna was with Drona it was not possible for anyone on Earth or Heaven to do anything to him. So he was elated when the Pandavas fell out with the Kauravas and were castigated from their Kingdom. He knew that Drona had remained on the side of the Kauravas and hatched a plan to get his revenge. He thought that if he could make a permanent alliance with Arjuna he can possibly have his revenge on Drona through him. So he arranged for this elaborate Sayamvar for Draupadi's marriage but the task he set for the competitors was so ridiculously difficult he was sure that no one else other than Arjuna would succeed. As the Pandavas at that time were in hiding living as poor Brahmins he kept the competition open for all with no restriction on age caste or creed.    What the story about Draupadi's birth tells us is that Draupadi was a woman on mission. She had to marry Arjuna as that was the way she could play out the role for which she was born. So when in the Sayamvar this unknown prince named Karna was about to complete the task which was supposed to be un-achievable to everyone except Arjuna she panicked.  I think it is time to mention what the task was. The task which all the competitors were suppose to try was to take the bow and arrow which were kept in the arena tie the string of the bow and shoot an arrow through the eye of a fish hanging from the ceiling. The archer was not supposed to look at the fish directly he was to do this task by just looking at the shadow of the fish on water kept in a tank. It is something like the picture below but the fish was actually kept at a farther distance than shown here. Anyway now the funny thing was that all the great Kings and Princes of the country failed to even tie the string to the bow because it was very heavy. But when Karna tried to do it he had no problem in tying the string and was about to shoot the effing eye off the fish! It was at this point Draupadi realized that this guy was going to nail it and the guy was none of the Pandavas. She had to stop it with an excuse and she chose to deride Karna for his caste. Karna's foster parents were Sut which is one of the so called ""lower castes"". Draupadi had nothing personal against Karna and she was not prejudiced against his caste it was just an excuse thought of in a haste. She wanted to marry only Arjuna as she believed that he was the only one who could help her accomplish her destiny.  But this public refusal was a great humiliation for Karna as all those who were present in the Sayamvar laughed and taunted him all those people who were no match for Karna in terms of strength and skills. But Karna the gentleman he is did not say anything offensive and politely bowed out of the competition. Draupadi felt terrible for doing what she did and noticed how handsome and a perfect gentleman Karna was. It was this incident which created a soft spot in Draupadi's heart for Karna. Obviously Arjuna completed the task with no problem and married the beautiful Draupadi. The next time the two came face to face was during the whole Vastraharan fiasco. For those who are not familiar the story is that the Pandavas had lost all they had in a gambling match with the Kauravas and after they had given up everything they even pawned their wife Draupadi and unsurprisingly lost. As a result the Kauravas who were not reputed to be very respectful of women tried to strip Draupadi in public.  The Pandavas had already pawned themselves in the game and had lost it so they were already slaves of the Kauravas and so was bound by some kind of shitty law of those times which said that they could not harm their masters no matter what they did. So the Kauravas decided to take the opportunity to humiliate Draupadi in the most crudest of ways. Karna who was a friend of the Kauravas was present in the court when this barbaric act was taking place. Draupadi recognized Karna and asked him for help. But Karna instead of helping Draupadi stood with the Kauravas and supported them. He even gave a few words of encouragement to the Kauravas (as if they needed any) and passed lewd comments. Draupadi was shocked by Karna's behavior as she remembered him as a real gentleman and great warrior. Finally Sri Krishna came to her rescue that day. Most of this story is known to many who have read Mahabharata or have watched the TV series.  However the interesting question is why didn't Karna say anything to stop the brutality that day? There are many different stories regarding this but one interpretation which I found plausible was that Karna was trying to instigate the Pandavas who were sitting like ducks and letting all these monstrosity go on. Karna could not do anything directly for Draupadi because he was bound by his friendship to the Kauravas and also if he tried to intervene people would raise eyebrows and gossips will start that Karna has a weakness for Draupadi. In reality he did have a weakness for her and that is why he was extra careful not to let his feelings show.He thought that the only way he could stop it is by inciting the Pandavas. He tried to do it by saying things like  ""Draupadi you should leave the Pandavas who are cowards and don't know how to protect you and instead marry the Kauravas."" All this was actually said to anger the Pandavas and push them into doing something to stop the horrible injustice on Draupadi. Alas they just fell on deaf ears.  While that was Karna's actual motive Draupadi thought that Karna still nurtured the grudge against her for publicly humiliating him during the Sayamvar and that is why he behaved so harshly and did not help her. Draupadi lost the soft spot she had for Karna after this incident until much later when Sri Krishna revealed to her Karna's actual motives that day. P.S. I missed out on Dhristadyumna in my initial answer. But thanks to Shrey I have edited my answer to incorporate it.",Satadru Das,https://www.quora.com/profile/Satadru-Das

But all powers material as well as spiritual come from God and that’s why Krishna stated that among great thinkers He is Ushana. Ushana was a great thinker but he wasn’t really a great sage. The Vedic sages are all devotees of Krishna. Among the sages Krishna says I am Vyasa or Narada. In the 10th chapter of Bhagavad Gita Krishna lists His oppulences and how these oppulences are represented in material nature. When Krishna says - of fish I am the shark. It doesn’t mean Krishna is a shark it means that the raw power and beauty of a shark come from God. It could be said that the shark is the god of the aquatics. Krishna says:Of the descendants of Vrishni I am Vasudeva and of the Pandavas I am Arjuna. Of the sages I am Vyasa and among great thinkers I am Ushana. —Bg 10.37Srila Prabhupada explains:Krishna is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead and Baladeva is Krishna's immediate expansion. Both Lord Krsna and Baladeva appeared as sons of Vasudeva so both of Them may be called Vasudeva. From another point of view because Krishna never leaves Vrndavana all the forms of Krishna that appear elsewhere are His expansions. Vasudeva is Krsna's immediate expansion so Vasudeva is not different from Krishna. It is to be understood that the Vasudeva referred to in this verse of Bhagavad-gita is Baladeva or Balarama because He is the original source of all incarnations and thus He is the sole source of Vasudeva. The immediate expansions of the Lord are called svamsa (personal expansions) and there are also expansions called vibhinnamsa (separated expansions). Amongst the sons of Pandu Arjuna is famous as Dhananjaya. He is the best of men and therefore represents Krishna. Among the munis or learned men conversant in Vedic knowledge Vyasa is the greatest because he explained Vedic knowledge in many different ways for the understanding of the common mass of people in this Age of Kali. And Vyasa is also known as an incarnation of Krsna; therefore Vyasa also represents Krishna. Kavis are those who are capable of thinking thoroughly on any subject matter. Among the kavis Ushana Sukracharya was the spiritual master of the demons; he was an extremely intelligent and far-seeing politician. Thus Sukracharya is another representative of the opulence of Krishna.,Jahnu Dasa,https://www.quora.com/profile/Jahnu-Dasa
RelatedWas beef eating common during the Vedic times in India and If yes how did it become sacrilegious over time?,https://www.quora.com/Was-beef-eating-common-during-the-Vedic-times-in-India-and-If-yes-how-did-it-become-sacrilegious-over-time,,"There are many beautiful answers already provided. I don't know anything about Vedas but I would like to share something i know about beef eating. First thing to be clear is that there is nothing sacrilegious about it If you know Hinduism deep enough and well enough you can see that there is no""Thou Shall not"" in Hinduism.  People in Ancient India always relied on improving Human Intelligence & Consciousness where they would naturally make good choices rather than simple belief systems that's the beauty of Hindu way of life and it should remain so.  Having said that it is to be made very clear that NO... it is not common in India to consume beef at all and it is indeed frowned upon why is that?.  REASON NO: 1 - BIG THREE In Indian culture we see Cow from mammals Snake from reptiles and Crow from birds as very close to human beings in evolution in terms of emotional display intelligence etc. Snake: Even now it is common that you don't kill a snake in India if you do you have to perform rites & rituals as you would do for a Human. Crow:Almost every form of rituals done to ancestors ends with an offering to a Crow. More recently you might have even seen videos from BBC on how intellectually capable a crow is. If not please see the following two videos  Cow:India which is largely an agrarian culture in the past relied heavily in the Milk Butter and other dairy products. All the homes gave individual names to the cows they reared and they are treated like a family member. A cow has a strong emotional display and shall actually shed tears if someone in the home dies or terminally ill etc. these incidences can be easily seen in rural areas. That's why Indians have a huge love for Cows in the same way many people love Dogs for it's emotional display. So Usage & Love for Cows is one of the prime reasons why Cows were not killed in India. Cow is a very versatile animal when alive almost everything from it can be used beautifully including it's dung & urine. Why we should just kill it for the meat? Ancient Indians were not stupid enough to kill the Goose that lays the golden egg. REASON NO: 2 - INDIAN FOOD CULTUREThe basic thumbrule of Indian food culture is that a Human being should consume food which is as far away from him as possible in evolutionary scale. i.e. it should start with Plant life then sea food then poultry then animals which are routed in the body and so on. (More in terms of Darwin's theory of evolution) This is the reason why even now over 40% of Indian are Vegetarian.Capability of a human being to digest the food will be much better if the food consumed is a simple life as opposed to a life which is higher up in evolutionary scale. There is another spiritual dimension to it which can be left out from this answer as it is not that relavant. That's why Cow is big 'No No' in India because it is seen almost as equal to Humans in terms of evolution. REASON NO: 3 - BASIC HUMANITY When we were born we drink milk from our Biological mother. When we grow up we mainly drink milk from the Cow. If we just drop all our belief systems conditions etc and just look honestly we can even say with gratitude that Cow is like a second mother to us. There are so many other options to eat & stay alive. The recent innovation in supply chain management is so good that we have managed to bring even Apples from halfway across the world to our doorsteps.  Is it really necessary to slaughter an animal which is versatile useful cries for you nourishes you in every way to satisfy your hunger? that's the basic question for which Indians say 'No it's not necessary' and they are labelled as fundamentalists.

They were aware that the society of that age would not take back those who were taken by another man. So they were left with nowhere to go. When Krishna asked them what they wanted to do they all wanted Krishna to marry them. Krishna married them all at the same auspicious time assuming that many bodies so they could gain status of married women and live in the society with honor again. Krishna constructed them each a palace with huge gardens ful of colorful flowers It was impossible to live with each of them so he created 16100 forms of himself so that he could treat them all in the same manner as his 8 wives. Scriptures say that each of them had 10 sons and 1 daughter. Note 1: Some stories say that each of 16100 women were rishis from the past who wanted to be part of Lord's incarnation on earth. Who wanted to live closer to him and witness his life. Upon their prayer to lord vishnu he granted them the boon to be his wives in his next incarnation on earth. Note 2: Some stories say 16100 women were Gopis who did not want to marry any one else but krishna who thus remained unmarried throughout their lives. Note 3: Another theory relates the Krishna who plays the flute and the lover of music and his 16000 wives to the 16000 ragas or musical modes or passions or affections of the mind in Indian classical music and their wives - the raginis (female raga). The raginis selected one of these ragas to which to modulate her strains for affecting and securing the heart of Krishna the amorous and harmonious deity. Krishna who was devoted to music received and enjoyed every variety of modulation multiplied to the number of 16000 fancifully personified in the form of the women derived from Bhauma (a name of Narakasura) a five-stringed musical instrument Last but not least- Lord Krishna is the Supreme Lord himself with all 16 characters of Lord Vishnu.

Just like nobody gave birth to Goddess Adi Shakti she took birth as Maa Sati and Maa Parvati. Goddess Lakshmi also took birth as Mata Sita and Radha Rukmini So Lord Narayan (Vishnu) is Ram and Krishna in human form. There’s no question about superior or inferior..

There are some funny answers here one points at a pillar to prove a point another one claims that Vikramaditya ruled Arabia. Social media played a huge role in fueling this rumour. Memes like this are doing rounds :Truth is Kaaba is not a Shiva temple. Before Mohammad started preaching a new religion the Arabians followed Arabian Paganism - a polytheistic faith system. [1] Kaaba was a holy site for Arabian Pagans and it hosted the idols of the pagan deities. The chief deity was Hubal - the moon god.After the invasion of Mecca Mohammad took over Kaaba and destroyed the idols present in the Kaaba. Since then it became a holy site for Muslims.Kaaba and Shivalinga rumour : The credit for linking Shivalinga with Arabs goes to Savarkar. In his book “Six glorious epochs of Indian history “ In paragraph 650 he claims Arabians worshipped Shivalinga. [2]Let’s not blame Savarkar entirely for the rumour. The rumour has a long history. The Islamic rumour about Somnath Lingam : In fact early Muslims thought that the Idol of Somnath Linga was the statue of Arabian pagan goddess. Romilla Thapar wrote : [3] “A major poet of the eastern Islamic world Farrukhi Sistani who claims that he accompanied Mahmud to Somanatha provides a fascinating explanation for the breaking of the idol. This explanation has been largely dismissed by modern historians as too fanciful but it has a significance for the assessment of iconoclasm. According to him the idol was not of a Hindu deity but of a pre-Islamic Arabian goddess. He tells us that the name Somnat (as it was often written in Persian) is actually Su-manat the place of Manat. We know from the Qur'an that Lat Uzza and Manat were the three pre-Islamic goddesses widely worshipped and the destruction of their shrines and images it was said had been ordered by the Prophet Mohammad. Al-lat Manat and Al-Uzza :Two were destroyed but Manat was believed to have been secreted away to Gujarat and installed in a place of worship. According to some descriptions Manat was an aniconic block of black stone so the form could be similar to a lingam. This story hovers over many of the Turko-Persian accounts some taking it seriously others being less emphatic and insisting instead that the icon was of a Hindu deity. THE identification of the Somanatha idol with that of Manat has little historical credibility. There is no evidence to suggest that the temple housed an image of Manat. Nevertheless the story is significant to the reconstruction of the aftermath of the event since it is closely tied to the kind of legitimation which was being projected for Mahmud.”It is interesting to note that early Muslims believed the rumour that Somnath Idol was that of Al-manat’s idol. While today’s far right Hindus believe Kaaba was a Shiva temple which hosted a Linga.Footnotes[1] Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia - Wikipedia[2] https://savarkar.org/en/pdfs/6_Glorious_Epochs_of_Indian_History.pdf[3] txt_thapar_somnath,Ambika Vijay,https://www.quora.com/profile/Ambika-Vijay

Kanakadasa had came to Udupi for worshipping in Krishna temple.The Brahmin priests would not let him enter the temple as he was from a ""low"" caste.Kanakadasa was outside the temple meditating on Lord Krishna and singing songs in praise of his Lord Krishna. He did this for weeks he is believed to have camped outside the temple for weeks cooking his own food and during this time he was so distraught he composed poems in praise of Krishna. It is believed that something unnatural happened those days when Kanakadasa was outside the temple for days waiting to see Lord Krishna and waiting to be let into the temple. It is believed that the during those dayskanaka was not allowed to have darshan of krishna with devotion when he sang kirthanas temple wall fell down and the deity of Lord Krishna turned around and there was a crack in the outer walls of the temple through which the ardent devotee of Krishna Kanakadasa was able to see his Lord. This left the orthodox community flabbergasted as to why something like this happened. Since then the Krishna idol has been facing west even though the main entrance has been facing east and this has remained a mystery every since.

Translation As all surrender unto Me I reward them accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects O son of Pṛthā. Purport Everyone is searching for Kṛṣṇa in the different aspects of His manifestations. Kṛṣṇa the Supreme Personality of Godhead is partially realized in His impersonal brahma-jyotir effulgence and as the all-pervading Supersoul dwelling within everything including the particles of atoms. But Kṛṣṇa is fully realized only by His pure devotees. Consequently Kṛṣṇa is the object of everyone’s realization and thus anyone and everyone is satisfied according to one’s desire to have Him. In the transcendental world also Kṛṣṇa reciprocates with His pure devotees in the transcendental attitude just as the devotee wants Him. One devotee may want Kṛṣṇa as supreme master another as his personal friend another as his son and still another as his lover. Kṛṣṇa rewards all the devotees equally according to their different intensities of love for Him. In the material world the same reciprocations of feelings are there and they are equally exchanged by the Lord with the different types of worshipers. The pure devotees both here and in the transcendental abode associate with Him in person and are able to render personal service to the Lord and thus derive transcendental bliss in His loving service. As for those who are impersonalists and who want to commit spiritual suicide by annihilating the individual existence of the living entity Kṛṣṇa helps also by absorbing them into His effulgence. Such impersonalists do not agree to accept the eternal blissful Personality of Godhead; consequently they cannot relish the bliss of transcendental personal service to the Lord having extinguished their individuality. Some of them who are not firmly situated even in the impersonal existence return to this material field to exhibit their dormant desires for activities. They are not admitted into the spiritual planets but they are again given a chance to act on the material planets. For those who are fruitive workers the Lord awards the desired results of their prescribed duties as the yajñeśvara; and those who are yogīs seeking mystic powers are awarded such powers. In other words everyone is dependent for success upon His mercy alone and all kinds of spiritual processes are but different degrees of success on the same path. Unless therefore one comes to the highest perfection of Kṛṣṇa consciousness all attempts remain imperfect as is stated in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam(2.3.10): akāmaḥ sarva-kāmo vāmokṣa-kāma udāra-dhīḥtīvreṇa bhakti-yogenayajeta puruṣaṁ param “Whether one is without desire [the condition of the devotees] or is desirous of all fruitive results or is after liberation one should with all efforts try to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead for complete perfection culminating in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.” ],Phillip Davies,https://www.quora.com/profile/Takethis-Knee

By “practical spirituality” -I do not mean the breathing meditation body positions supernatural powers rituals beliefs or devotion… butI mean the practical wisdom about the reality as it is practical wisdom applicable in the daily life of individuals and society for the goodness of humankind.The Purusa hymn of the Rig-Veda is purely practical spiritual hymn. It brings to us the practical wisdom about both macro (universe/nature) and micro (humankind) world and the Purusa “position” in both of them. But not only that. It brings to us the wisdom about the reality of the existence of a spiritual human being itself. The Purusa hymn discloses the eternal constituency of a human being as a spiritual being. The hymn deals with the four constituents of every individual human being! Every one! The terms Brahman Rájanya Vaisya and Súdra are not the term of four different types of human beings!!! No! They describe everyone human being as an individual having in itself all four constituencies. Those four constituents do not explain only the physical body parts as such; the mouth arms thighs and feet. They explain the practical spiritual realities of a human being. Those parts of the body are symbolic representatives of the spiritual realities. Surely the four-body part were not chosen occasionally; the functions of the four body parts fit the role to help explaining the practical spiritual realities. 1. Human being is a spiritual being. Its essence is in its faculty of thinking standing on unity of self-awareness and consciousness. The thinking faculty has its key channel of expression inside the human body (from the practical spiritual point of view) not in the brain but in the mouth. The mouth is the instrument through which proceeds a human being´s wisdom accumulated by life experiences observation and reflection of the reality. Through the mouth goes out the character and values. A human being is a Brahman when his/her mouth is a channel for practical spiritual experiential wisdom. 2. The arms of human beings are the instruments of ruling the things based on the practical spiritual experiential wisdom. The arms symbolizes the reality that the ruling has to reflect the wisdom that a spiritually matured wise human being is naturally following his/her wisdom in his ruling actions. In this context a wise human being is also a king and administrator the ruler of the things. At the same time a wise human being is a guarder of the wisdom. It should fight to secure the society rules standing on wisdom against ignorance arrogance and violence. In this context a wise human being is also a warrior. 3. The daily life of a spiritually wise human being and a spiritual ruler namely their missions as Brahman and Rájanya depends on their daily work necessary for securing the life; not only their life but also the life of the society. Thus the thigs represents a natural necessity to secure the food (agriculture) and exchange of materials and products (merchants) for the goodness of the society. Simply stated they represent the daily work. 4. The feet are the most “delicate” aspect of a spiritually matured human being. To give a clear analogy for the right understanding I will use a suitable example. The feet represents the slag/scoria/dross or scum (if we wish) which are the inevitable result/residue in metallurgy within the purification work of creating metals in blast/annular furnace – and in the same way they are the inevitable result/residue in our spiritual work (spiritual metallurgy) within our spiritual purification work – cleaning from ignorance non-compassion and irresponsibility etc. We must do ON OURSELF the Sudra work! NOBODY can do this work for us!! Our feet also as the lowest part of our spiritual oven (human body as a “blast furnace”) are the container for falling down slag as a result of our work on purification. Our spiritual experiential growing in all of three roles (Brahman Rajanya Vaisya) is leaving the residues (smelling mineral slag) in our foot. Thus we should make clean our feet to make them light to make them free from slag to wash away the sinter (smelling dirty sediment) as a natural residue of our hard work in all three realms of the life of a spiritual human being for the goodness of humankind. How simple! Is not it? Did you catch it? The Purusa hymn DOES NOT SPEAK AT ALL ABOUT THE FOUR VARNA / CASTE SOCIAL SYSTEM! NO! IN NO WAY! You Hindu people should be pride of your original practical spiritual wisdom of the ancient Vedic way of life. It was the wisdom about the implementation of the spiritual experiential knowledge into the daily life! The social system of the ancient Vedic way of life was WISE - wise thinking wise ruling wise defending wise work and wise cleaning of slag… It is so painful watching today´s corruption of the ancient Vedic way of life and hearing the ignorant arguments that already in Vedas there were the principles of the four social birth-based castes. That is a horrible issue! The ancient wisdom of India was heavily corrupted first by sterile philosophizing and later by superstitious and superficial religion standing on blind belief and servile devotion. How much misunderstandings mis-leadings misusing etc. is connected with the attempts to use this hymn as a confirmation that the bad and sick caste system of India was created and authorized by Vedas. NO! It was the spiritual ignorance philosophy and religion which created the destructive phenomenon of castes! All scriptures which later started presenting the four Varnas as the birth-based social system are the worst enemies of your spiritual heritage. You should fight against this fallacy ignorance and blasphemy! You are the descendant of the wise thinking ruling working and cleaning… Any sustainable changes for the goodness of Indian people for their dignified life is not possible without coming back to the roots of Indian wisdom.,Stefan Pecho,https://www.quora.com/profile/Stefan-Pecho

Some selling their believs as facts some confirming a heaven up there (and hence a flat earth as round earth has no ‘up’). Some diluting by deviating into other things. Before this question can even be asked or understood some fact checking is required:What is called ‘Allah’ in arabian is called ‘Shiva’ in Indian languages. DO NOT freak out just have courage to read from Islamic books what ‘Allah’ is and from Shiv Purana what ‘Shiva’ is. Its religious fanatics who try to confine to vocabulary of a particular region. So when someone talks about Allah they are talking about Shiva in their own preferred vocabulary.People do confirm that there was something some place of worship that was destroyed by Muhammad. No one denies it. In Indian languages that some place is called temple. So essentially some ‘temple’ was destroyed. This is very similar to destruction of other known temples that were partially restored later like Krishna temple in Mathura or Shiva temple in Kashi.Was Mecca a Shiva temple then? No one can claim other than history. It needs courage to dig into history and find truth. Fear of finding undesirable usually freaks people out. It would require to search for records of what ‘temple’ was there if any such thing is still available.So do Muslim worship? it depends on how you interpret word ‘worship’. Its an English word from European culture it may not fit as is in other cultures.So do muslim pray to Shiva? If they prefer to use word ‘Allah’ for their faith there is no reason for anyone to poke in as faith is very personal and internal matter. At the same time a vocabulary cannot be imposed on others. This same logic will apply other way. If you tell a Shiva bhakt that he / she is worshipping Allah you land into similar problems though with lesser extent.Now if you are commited to the exclusiveness you might try to find more differences that do not confirm with original sources. With open mind all you will see are similarities and interpretations and misguidances over centuries.,Pankaj Gupta,https://www.quora.com/profile/Pankaj-Gupta-541

As he died on the holy battlefield of Kurukshetra he deserves his place in heaven.” Yudhisthira still in a rage enquired about his brothers and all the warriors who died under his command. On hearing the words of Yudhisthira Indra asked a celestial messenger to guide the son of Dharma.Image courtesy: Google images The messenger walked out of the place on Indra’s command and Yudhisthira followed him. Soon they entered a region of darkness. Yudhisthira felt something bad about the place. As he walked further he could hear voices. Some were of animals and some were painful scream of humans undergoing torture. Deadly creatures and insects infested the place and a foul odour followed them everywhere. There were numerous corpses lying on the ground stained in blood. Each moment in that place was full of pain. There was no sign of life. There was no auspicious sign to heal a soul. The rivers were filled with blood and the trees had thorns instead of fruits. Yudhisthira asked the messenger where were they going? The messenger remained silent. He kept walking and hence Yudhisthira also followed in silence. After walking for a while the messenger stopped and looked back. He said” I have been permitted to come till here. I don’t have permission to go beyond. I should return. It would be best if you follow me and return back to our place.” Yudhisthira could not understand anything. He thought he was going to see his brothers and his wife. Instead he was at an unknown and inauspicious place. The messenger was ready to return. Yudhisthira also turned back to return with him. But then he heard cries coming from all directions. “Don’t leave us oh king! You have brought us an air of relief. Stay for a while.” Yudhisthira sensed the familiarity in those voices. He asked” What is this voice? Who are you? Why are you calling me?” Suddenly there were responses from all directions” It’s me. Draupadi” “ I am Bhima”…” I am Karna”. Yudhisthira was heartbroken. He screamed in pain” What kind of justice is this? Those sinners are in heaven and my beloved people are tormented in this hell” He turned to the messenger and shouted in angry voice”Go tell the gods I would not return. I will stay here with my people. If my presence could bring even a little relief to these pure souls I would bear this pain for eternity. Now leave!” The messenger returned and gave the message to Sakra (Indra). In a while all the gods along with Indra went to the place where Yudhisthira was mourning for his loved ones. At once the darkness disappeared and the foul smell was replaced by a heavenly scent. A divine presence occupied the whole place. Indra appeared before Yudhisthira with Dharma himself. Dharma spoke to his son proudly” Oh son! You have passed my test once again. You remember when you lied to Drona about his son Ashwatthama. Drona died because of your lie. You deceived him. That was your only sin my son! That is why you had to suffer this pain in hell. This was just an illusion to punish you for your sin. All beings must go to hell for their sins. Those who commit a lot of sin ascend to the heavens first so that they could live the fruits of their good karma before heading to hell. The souls who have lived their life righteously and did a small number of wrong deeds first go through hell to finally ascend to heaven.” Yudhisthira was relieved. He was taken by Indra in the different loks to show him where his brothers and kinsmen were? Indra told Yudhisthira” Your brothers have already paid for their sins and have attained high place in the heaven. Arjun is with Narayana himself. Bhima is with the Maruts. Nakula and Sahadev are with the Ashwins. The great Abhimanyu is with Soma (the Moon god). Karna is with his father Surya dev (the Sun god). Draupadi has submerged and become a part of Shree. All those who died in that war have attained their place in their respective worlds.” Yudhisthira also took his place in the heavens along with his father Dharma. So Pandavas didn’t go to hell. They attained hell for a short period of time as everyone is destined to go.,Khushboo Singh,https://www.quora.com/profile/Khushboo-Singh-946

In Valmiki Ramayana you can see all human emotions such as delight happiness humor emotion etc. When only thinking about Devi Sita her patience power Pativrata Dharma comes to our mind.There are several instances in Ramayana you can see how deep and how pure the love between Sri Ram and Mata Sita had! When Lord Rama got exiled Devi Sita too wanted to follow him leaving all luxuries and kingdom. When Devi Sita insisted to go with him Lord Rama had to give up and agreed to take her in the forest. If you see in Valmiki Ramayana when Devi Sita was abducted by Ravana Sri Rama went to the state of madness! He would wake up at night calling “Sita! Oh Sita”!:न एव दंशान् न मशकान् न कीटान् न सरी सृपान् | राघवो अपनयेत् गत्रात् त्वत् गतेन अन्तः आत्मना || ५-३६-४२ Meaning: ""With his mind wholly devoted to you Rama is not even driving away forest-flies from his body nor mosquitoes nor insects nor reptiles from his body."" नित्यम् ध्यान परो रामो नित्यम् शोक परायणः | न अन्यच् चिन्तयते किंचित् स तु काम वशम् गतः || ५-३६-४३ Meaning: ""Rama always cogitates on something or the other. He is forever engaged in sorrow. He is enamored with the god of love and thinks of nothing else.""He seemed like a mad man wandering off the trees to hillocks:   This is what Sri Rama says to his dearest wife:न देवि तव दुःखेन स्वर्गमप्यभिरोचये। न हि मेऽस्ति भयं किञ्चित्स्वयम्भोरिव सर्वतः।।2.30.27। When you are in grief O Devi I do not desire even heaven. Like the selfcreated Brahma I have no fear for any one. आरभस्व शुभश्रोणि वनवासक्षमाः क्रियाः। नेदानीं त्वदृते सीते स्वर्गोऽपि मम रोचते।।2.30.42।। O Sita begin right now all preparations necessary for residing in the forest. O one with beautiful buttocks without you even the very heaven does not please me. सदृशं चानुरूपं च कुलस्य तव चात्मनः। सधर्मचारिणी मे त्वं प्राणेभ्योऽपि गरीयसी।।3.10.22।। Your auspicious words are quite befitting your lineage. You are the follower of my dharma and so dearer to me than my life.When Devi was kidnapped than his love goes to state of madness! Such high class of love:""Oh wind! Flow from the side of my beloved. Touch her and touch me too. It is through you that I get a contact of her limbs. It is through moon that I get a contact of her eyes."" ""It is enough for me who is passionate that Seetha with charming thighs and myself are resting on one the same earth and on this fact I am able to survive."" ""Even as a paddy-field without water survives by getting wet from a neighboring paddy-field under water I also survive since I am hearing her as surviving.This much deep was his love for Devi Sita! Now talking about Agni Parikshya When Sita was rescued and came before Shri Rama after many months Shri Rama spoken outwardly harsh words for the first time ever to anyone and that too to his dearest Sita (as Shri Rama had to bring out the purest divine exalted nature of Sita in front of all the three worlds so he hid his inner heart how much he loves Sita so that after knowing Sita is innately pure and divine people could accept Sita with him with whole heart). And then Sita on her own independently took decision to enter in pyre and She ordered Lakshmana to get a pyre ready for her - tears were already rolling down the eyes of Shri Rama Yet he remained silent and firm so was also Sita firm in her decision and inside both were one at heart and supporting each other's dharma and leela. Shri Rama was well aware inside his heart that his consort Sita is purest and protected by her own divine splendor however in order to silence the lowly minds of the world this was necessary on the part of Sita and Sita did independently on her. Sita and Rama being the best suited to each other always supported each other's leela and dharma independently and inconspicuously in the best possible way even without communicating in the words to each other.And thus Sita's divine nature was revealed when she entered in the fire in order to end her life; the fire-god couldn't bear the divine-splendor of Sita as She herself is the fire of fire Sita suppressed the original nature of the fire which burns everything; all the three worlds saw this divine leela unfolded independenly by Sita and silently supported by her consort whole world was convinced about her purity and innately pure noblest character and divine nature that she was protected by her own splendor and she was always devoted to Rama in by action speech mind and soul in everyway even when she was in separation of her husband due to adverse fate met to her.When fire-god appeared to tell Shri Rama that Sita is purest then Shri Rama told the fire-god:अनन्यहृदयां भक्तां मचत्तपरिवर्तिनीम् ।अहमप्यवगच्छामि मैथिलीं जनकात्मजाम् ॥इमामपि विशालाक्षीं रक्षितां स्वेन तेजसा ।रावणो नातिवर्तेत वेल मिव महोदधिः ॥प्रत्ययार्थं तु लोकानां त्रयाणाम् सत्यसंश्रयः ।उपेक्षे चापि वैदेहीं प्रविशन्तीं हुताशनम् ॥(श्री वाल्मीकि रामायण ६-११८.१६-१७) Shri Rama said to fire-god “I know that Sita the daughter of Janaka who ever revolves in my mind is undivided in her devotion to me. Ravana could not violate this wide-eyed woman protected as she was by her own divine splendour. Only in order to convince the three worlds I whose refugee is truth ignored Sita while she was entering in the fire.""Had this episode of agnipareeksha (fire-ordeal) not happened in Ramayana would Sita have been taken as devi to be worshipped alongside Shri Rama without objections by lowly minds? Sita to be installed as devi in hearts of people certainly deserves this pure factory ordeal in the eyes of the people as she had resided for a long time indeed in the gynaecium of Ravana. Had Shri Rama accepted Sita without her giving a convincing defense for her purity and character people would chatter against Rama that Rama was really foolish person who came into lust of a beautiful woman to accept her inspite of she lived in the gynaecium of Ravana for long!When Sita emerged unscathed from fire and fire couldn't burn Sita all the three worlds was convinced of her divinity Sita had her own splendor and divinity from which she protected her dignity and purity from Ravana without any weapon by mere holding a blade of grass which even mighty Ravana couldn't transgress. Being a devi herself She really didn't need Shri Rama to rescue her from Ravana She said to Ravana if She wishes she can reduce him into ashes anytime but as She has no inclination of Shri Rama (her Bhagavan) for this so she is not willing to do so which shows her all time Paartantryam to Bhagavan in his association as well as while being without association of Bhagavan. She had to exhibit the quality of Paartantryam (being always dependent on Bhagavan) for all devotees and being Purushkara of Bhagavan it was all her grace and causeless mercy only over demons that she allowed herself in the captive of Ravana to preach him and other demons to take refuge of Shri Rama.After this Sita and Rama returned to Ayodhya. Shri Rama and Mata Sita lived in Ayodhya for many thousand Years together. And them some sections of people started evil-talks about chastity of Sita they started casting aspersions on the character of Sita. It hurt Shri Rama a lot and finally Shri Rama had to take a decision to leave Sita near the hermitage of Valmiki.How and why did Shri Rama who loved Sita more than his own life take decision to send Sita into exile near the hermitage of Valmiki? Shri Rama enjoyed with Sita for 10000 years in Ayodhya  and now the time was near for Sita and Rama for winding up their avatara-leela on the earth and enter in their divine spiritual abode and disappear from the mortal eyes of the world; the divine couple needed an excuse for this as Sita and Rama can't grow old or die like general humans of the mortal world. Therefore in order to end their incarnations due to their divine inspiration story took again a sad turn a minor section of population started chattering against the character of Sita Ji and her purity Not just one dhobi (washerman). And Lord had to reluctantly abandon his dearest Sita and Lord took it as pretext for winding up his avatara-leela on the earth and He entered in his divine unseen spiritual dhaam with all his subject and Jivas gathered in Ayodhya after sometime.When one day Shri Rama was talking with his spies and friends in the matter of public opinion about him and the royal family. Then Shri Rama heard from one of his spies that such ill rumors about Sita's chastity has been slowly spreading in his subject. Sita had become an issue for some people. Those words of spy were like arrows piercing the heart of Shri Rama. Shri Rama was so hurt when he heard that some sections of people are evil-speaking about the most chaste Sita his dearest consort.That minor section of population started telling because of our virtuous and ideal king Rama we would also have to tolerate the scandals of our wife with other men and still keep them in our house if they return back to us. Though Sita had already given fire-test in Lanka and had convinced all the three words about her purity and character all gods of heaven and monkeys and demons have seen that Yet that time no one was there from Ayodhya except Shri Rama and Lakshmana.So people may arguge if Sita had given fire-test in Lanka then she could have give it once more in Ayodhya to silence the evil-talks against her character and purity. Shri Sita Ji had given the fire-test in Lanka on her own as per her personal capacity and dharma no one had asked her to give such severe test she did on her own to convince all the three worlds so that none could raise objections on Shri Rama her husband in future that Shri Rama is some lusty man to accept her. However if someone else demands such test from Sita or any other women then it would not be appropriate. If all compassionate Lord Shri Rama on behalf of him puts Sita for another test in Ayodhya in that case Lord would have to put other women also through such test to maintain discipline in the society whenever some rascals utter some doubt over the characters of other women. And definitely all merciful and wisest Lord didn't want this to happen ever and to be seen as some tyrannical ruler to put women through such test if others cast doubts over the characters of some women. Therefore Lord thought it is better to sacrifice his personal happiness and send Sita into exile rather than facing or inviting such horrible situations ever.Every person with questionable past is entitled to convince others as per one's own capability and dharma it can't be imposed by others. It was not appropriate for Sita herself or wisest Shri Rama (to involve Sita again publicly) to convince such people even after the fire-ordeal episode of Sita Ji in Lanka in front of him and innumerable gods demons monkeys etc. No fire-test was asked by Shri Rama even in Lanka and so again a fire-test was out of question as this time questions were raised by public so this would bring a burden on common worldly mortal women in future if others ask to prove their purity.Now have a look over the situation and the alternatives as a King of Ayodhya and the husband of Sita Ji Shri Rama had that time before him to take further course of action(s) :- 1) Duty: Sri Rama was the king of Ayodhya not a simple common man who could ask justice from the king or royal authority for his beloved wife that some people are talking ill about his wife. A common man is generally self-centric towards his wife and family but for a King whole subject is like his own children. Primary duty of a king is to renounce own pleasures for the pleasure of his subject that was the prime-principle in those days for a king. Obviously when one is head of some state one gets greater responsibility towards the state and its people. Shri Rama as a King had not to be biased towards his kith and kin his own wife if some people raise complain against his family members. Therefore Shri Rama had neither an option to ask justice for his beloved wife nor he could go openly against the sections of public otherwise he would be labelled as a biased king for his wife who is punishing people for the sake of his wife.Had Shri Rama suppressed the voice of the minority sections of public for his own family member (even after being innocent and ensuring justice for a particular person of royal family) then certainly there was a chance of losing the good-faith of those majority section of public who were loyal and devout towards Shri Rama and Sita. Losing the faith of majority section of public would have brought anarchy in the kingdom. Forcibly suppressing the minority voice was not the Raj-Dharma of subject-loving king like Lord Shri Rama. (Please note it - those minority sections of people were just rumoring not revolting against Ayodhya or king Rama.)Therefore Shri Rama had only one option of banishing Sita quietly in some safest place out of Ayodhya and give an opportunity to common people to decide on themselves on their own about the queen of Ayodhya what is wrong and what is right whether talking evil about the most chaste Sita is good or bad without asking them or reminding them and if Sita could become agreeable to all as queen of Ayodhya as on later stage Shri Rama could take appropriate action to restore Sita's glory in general public with all respect. Definitely King is not an appropriate person to judge about himself or his family-members in case of allegations directed to them. Therefore Shri Rama quietly banished Sita to close down the matter for sometime and this was the only way to have a check on the rumour spreading further in whole public in presence of Sita in Ayodhya which could have hurt her more. Shri Rama was verily aware that Sita is pregnant so he told Lakshmana to leave Sita around in the vicinity of the hermitage of Sage Valmiki near the bank of river Ganga. (-Valmiki Ramayana)This was the clear order of Lord Sri Rama to Lakshmana to leave Sita in the vicinity of Valmiki's hermitage. Had Shri Rama not cared about Sita why he would have told Lakshmana to take care to leave Sita in the forest around the hermitage of sage Valmiki where she finally found the shelter. Definitely Shri Rama displayed his extreme care and love for Sita as a great husband not only in ensuring her self-respect by providing a suitable place where she could lead her life in self-esteem and should not be treated bad anymore by anyone but also cared of her requirement and dependence while being pregnant.Here Shri Rama provided the most suitable place for Sita because just before Sita's banishment Sita had expressed her willingness to spend some time in hermitage of sages and Valmiki's hermiatge was the only suitable place for Sita for proper care of her with fatherly love of Valmiki. Sage Valmiki was a great friend of Dasratha and near his hermitage there was hermitage of female ascetics no one would ask Sita any unwanted question as ascetics people don't taunt or care much about wordly affairs. Sita delivered twins in hermitage of sage-Valmiki. ( Later on when Kush-Luva sang the divine life-story of Shri Rama and the most chaste Sita in their melodious voice those sections of people lamented on their deeds of spreading rumors about Sita.)I request readers to think on their own - Did Shri Ram do any thing wrong in sending his dearest consort Sita who was more dear than his own life to a respectable place where she could lead her life with high esteem in the hermitage of Valmiki? Where her sons should not have to listen about infamy in public about their mother? Where none was knowing her and her past life and also not interested in her past life because of their ascetic-attitude? Should a Husband force his wife to live in a place where people speak ill about her chastity? Never Sri Ram had to ensure justice to his dear consort too so he chose the way of physical separation and provided her the best suitable place where she could live in high esteem and with great respect in her surrounding.If this case would have been brought in any modern court the court would have ensured a respectable place to Sita in form of separation from Ayodhya the court could have ensured justice to Sita in this way only as like what Sri Ram did with no punishment to others as one can't restrict the freedom of speech since Ram-Rajya was not an autocratic rule. Sri Ram did pure justice to Sita in providing a better place than Ayodhya (in fact the best suitable place) where none was interested in the past life of Sita in the hermitage of Sage Valmiki. Sage Valmiki was a friend of King Dasaratha and a fatherly figure to both Shri Ram and Sita. So in old days in adverse situation It is allowed to keep wife for sometime in her father's house or in the house of Purohit (sagacius personality). Valmiki was like a father and sagacious person both.3) Another option for Shri Rama had that he could have renounced his duties as a king of Ayodhya for his dearest consort Sita definitely it would be a great relief for her. But was it feasible for Shri Rama? (Many feminists put this argument that wouldn't it be a better option Had Sri Ram renounced his duties as the king and leave Ayodhya along with Sita ji?) If Rama would have renounced his duties for the sake of Sita Ji alone people would say see Rama has run away from his duties just for his wife. Then that minority section of people would have become more vocal in spreading rumour against the most chaste Sita who were talking in low voice from the fear of possible punishment from king. So Shri Rama being king of Ayodhya was always in favour of maa Sita not for any personal gain but at least it may have generated some sympathy among people towards their ascetic king in future as because of them only king Rama who loved his wife most had to silently send his beloved wife in forest.Renouncing duties would have definitely brought an infamy not only for Rama but also for glorious Suryavansha Dynasty as whole. How could have Rama done justice towards those pious rulers of his ancestors of the most glorious Ikshvaku-dynasty? Definitely Renouncing the duties of King by Rama would have tarnished the glory earned by his ancestors. It is told in scriptures that for the sake of the interest of family one should leave an Individual; for the sake of interest of a village one should leave a family; for the sake of interest of a city one should leave a village; and for the sake of interest of a state one should leave a city.What an example would have Rama set for the people by leaving a kingdom for his own sake or for his wife? Therefore to avoid bringing infamy to his forefathers Sri Rama who loved Sita most as like his own soul maintained physical separation from her. Please note it it was just a physical separation Rama never banished Sita from his heart. How can Rama banish her from his heart who is his very own soul? Rama never ever thought of any other woman; while being a King he could have married second time or more than one princess after her banishment. Multiple marriages were common practice for a king in those days and when Shri Rama started Ashvamedha-Yajna physical presence of wife was must along with husband yet Rama didn't marry and in place of her beloved consort he installed golden-Sita (Golden statues of Sita) in Yajna-place.Such was the divine love of Rama and Sita which has no match in history! So how can anyone raise questions on Dharma of Lord Rama? Can anyone be more caring for Sita than her own consort Lord Shri Rama? Was Rama enjoying in Ayodhya without Sita? Not only True lovers and devotees of Sri Sri Sita Ram but any sincere reader of Rama would cry throughout while reading this episode from Valmiki Ramayana not only for Sita Ji but also for Sri Ram! A great calamity was fallen on both who suffered more can't be said this separation brought equal suffering to the divine couple! who is to be blamed at this juncture only fate of the divine couple Shri Rama and Sita!Oh Rama for your Sita for protecting her respect in her presence so that she couldn't be hurt more You took all blame on yourself so that foolish people could raise questions on your Patni-Dharma? Yet it is irony that some foolish people who have no understanding of Dharma who never cared to read Ramayana raise question on Shri Rama's Patni-dharma Rama who is the embodiment of Dharma!4) Shri Rama can't bear the tears of Sita crying in front of him for her sake he can destroy entire cosmos (- Valmiki Ramayana) so He instructed Lakshmana to leave Sita in the forest. In Lakshmana's own words to Sita while he was crying by laying down his head in her feet before leaving her near the hermitage of Sage Valmiki:-""We couldn't utter the shameful words going in Ayodhya about you inspite of you being innocent."" O' Mother ""Rama has done this to check the circulation of this infamy of Yours and Himself therefore You should not take it otherwise (that he has any doubt in you) !!! ""O' Mother as per the order of Rama I am leaving near the hermitage of sage Valmiki a great ascetic who has been a great friend of our father Dashratha.""(As Sage Valmiki was a great friend of Dasratha so he has been fatherly character and guardian for both Rama and Sita. Hence in this way Sita was always in her Sasural/house of father-in-law. Shri Rama provided the best guardian for protecting his princess yet he just distanced himself physically from Sita but Sita was always enshrined in his heart.) Then after being striken by enormous grief of Rama forsaken her Sita spoke following words to Lakshmana to convey it to Rama:-She told ""O Raghava I wished for sometime to live in hermitage of sages How could I live alone without You? "" ""O Raghuvira You know me pure and that I have been solely devoted to you still you have forsaken your beloved consort due to fear of her infamy in public."" (Lord Rama had taken such a curse upon himself which separated himself from his princess who is dear like his own soul.) ""O Raghava the citizens of Ayodhya ought to be treated by you like your own family whatever you have done (of being impartial and forsaking me to check the infamy in public)is the supreme Dharma for you which will bring an unparralled fame to you."" ""O Raghava for a wife Husband is everything her god her friend and her preceptor. Just as a husband and king of Ayodhya it was necessary for You to rectify the public censure in the same way as Your wife it is my responsibility also (to rectify this infamy)! ""Devi Sita was truly knowing that her prince will never enjoy a single moment in separation with her. Hence whatever Sri Rama did was as per the Dharma Dharma is very subtle It needs proper merit and refined intellect to understand it in true sense. If a king does Adharma so what his subject will learn? If a father does Adharma his children may be bewildered and may fall in Adharma so whole blame will go to his father who couldn't set example for his children. 5. People ask Why did Sri Ram care so much to preserve the fame and fear of infamy (and public scandal)? A great father always take extreme care in his actions so that He could set an example in him a standard for his children so that his children could emulate him and be successful by following his virtues morals and standards set by him in his lifetime they could follow their father proudly! He never does anything which can make his children learn something bad from him. Now Being the Chakrvarti Samrat of whole earth (a truly people's king) Sri Ram the upholder of Dharma wished that his example be the timeless for the whole humanity for generations to come for everyone as example of an Ideal king an Ideal husband an Ideal son Ideal brother Ideal disciple etc Sri Ram set an example in him for everyone so that following him everyone could be successful in their duties and none could deviate from their Dharma. And his plans worked perfectly Now so much time passed and He is still remembered by people as best of men. People look towards Shri Ram and give his example as the highest role model in this whole existence! Sri Rama is the only personality whom people could emulate completely he is the highest standard this is the reason He is Purushottama (the best among men) in true sense! People have been looking towards him and will always look towards him.Source:Sita-Tyag and Inner meaning JAI SIYARAM!",Shree Keshava,https://www.quora.com/profile/Shree-Keshava

Indian leaders tried hard to stop the Muslims from splitting out but the negotiations failed. Thus a new nation of Pakistan was created out of a couple of Muslim-majority provinces in India's side.  The issue was that those provinces had a lot of non-Muslims too and India herself had plenty of Muslims elsewhere. In the months following India's independence in August 1947 millions were caught on the wrong side of the new border and were forced to move out. Millions died in the process. India blames Pakistan for all the Hindus & Sikhs that Pakistanis killed and Pakistan blames India for all the Muslims the Indians killed. Thus both nations started with bad blood.Border wars: Indian and Pakistan have fought 4 wars to deal with unresolved boundaries. Thrice the war was over the state of Jammu & Kashmir (whose monarch signed a deal to join with India) and once over India's decision to split Pakistan to create the new nation of Bangladesh. Indians are pissed that Pakistan sends its terrorists into Kashmir while Pakistan are pissed that they didn't get Kashmir.  That is pretty much all a layman outside the subcontinent needs to know to start with. As you understand the issue more deeply you can see different perspectives and different issues.,Balaji Viswanathan,https://www.quora.com/profile/%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B2%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%9C%E0%AE%BF-%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B8%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%A8%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%A9%E0%AF%8D-Balaji-Viswanathan

The question that comes up again and again is this one: you have this god with unlimited powers who knows everything and who is all-good so why is there so much suffering in the world? Inevitably when you ask a version of this question your religious elders will give you answers that sound like they’re making up excuses. Or they will shut you down by telling you not to ask such questions. But the questions don’t go away. You’re left still wondering. Then you learn about evolution and you think: that makes sense! And you learn about religious myths from other cultures and you think: hmm that’s kind of like what I grew up believing. Then slowly the weird stories from your religion stop making sense. You cross out the talking snakes and the walking on water and the flying horses etc. Okay you think now I have a good religion without all the hard-to-believe stuff. Then you dig deeper and you realize that even the “good” parts have problems: xenophobia sexism slavery exhortations to kill people who offend your faith or to go to war against them. That makes you uncomfortable. You decide you need a break from religion to think things through. You meditate and cogitate and wonder and ponder and you decide that you just can’t adhere to organized religion. You’re going to believe in your god but you can’t in good conscience be part of a religion whose texts advocate actions you consider morally abhorrent. Then you hear people talk of God. Every time they give arguments for his existence it sounds hollow. That’s a really weak argument you think to yourself. Over time you start rolling your eyes when people tell you that everything happens for a reason or that God will take care of it/you or that someone who has just died is in a better place now. Slowly you start to realize that you just don’t think there is a god. This frightens you at first because you’ve been raised to think that atheists are immoral. But when you try to believe you just can’t shake the feeling that you have no more evidence for the god you believe in than the ancient Egyptians and Greeks did about their many gods. You come to view gods as nothing more than the expression and translation of our hopes into mythological form and the ever-shrinking total sum of what we do not yet understand. That’s why many of us don’t believe. We’ve read the books and heard the sermons and attended the religious services and participated in the rituals and sung the songs. But we also studied the history and exposed our minds to more than just the internal logic of the religion we happen to be born into. And once you’ve opened those doors it’s almost impossible to close them again.,Habib F,https://www.quora.com/profile/Habib-F-2

Thousands of years ago it signified that a person has studied Veda and is trained in performance of yajnas. Then later by association it came to mean purity of thought word and deed. However in the present day I don’t see even Brahmins studying Veda or following shAstra. So in present times wearing a sacred thread has lost all meaning. It has become just a meaningless ritual. I know traditionalists and ritualists will object to what I have said. But it is the truth. Wearing a sacred thread without having studied Veda is like a beggar who finds a nice suit in the garbage and wears it thinking he is a rich man. Now I’m not saying that Brahmins should cut up their sacred threads. I’m saying if they still wear sacred thread let them make an effort to lead a true Brahmin life as prescribed in scriptures.

I had started with thiruvabharanam from pandalam. Those who have gone with this away to sabarimala know it takes 3 days and it's a tough journey to walk without chappals in tarred roads. People walk along with thiruvabharanam during the day and rest at a temple where the thiruvabharanam is kept for the night. On the second day of our start my legs had swollen and I was limping way behind the actual procession of thiruvabharanam. I was concerned I will miss the makarajyoti due to my slow progress and was praying to aiyappa. Sometime during the day I saw a middle aged swami with irumudi approaching me and asking what happened. I showed him my injured legs and reason for slow progress. He said wear his chappals and go you will reach on time. I refused to take it and tried to pay him. He didnot accept and told me to take the chappal. Swami gave me his chappal and started walking in front of me. After sometime I lost sight of him. Don't know if it was some helpful soul who came to help me.,Ganesh Muralidharan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Ganesh-Muralidharan-1
RelatedIs it true that the Quran contradicts itself?,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-the-Quran-contradicts-itself?no_redirect=1,,"———————————This answer is so long ———————————- First let me tell you that i didn’t want to answer this question because i don’t like encouraging people taking their information from anti-Islam sources. I will address the points he mentioned one-by-one : (Statements in Bold are the claims) (Do not they consider the Quran (with care)? Had it been from other than Allah they would surely have found therein much discrepancy) - Surah 4 verse 82There are several problems with this verse first it says if the Quran had been from someone other than Allah we would have found much discrepancy in it. So if a book is written by anyone other than Allah it will be filled with discrepancies but this is just silly!Answer : Yeah this is silly. You see what he did here? he made a straw-man argument. Allah didn’t say “if a book is written by anyone..etc” Allah talks about the Quran specifically. Allah didn’t say (Do not they consider any book (with care)? Had it been from other than Allah they would surely have found therein much discrepancy) rather he said (Do not they consider the Quran (with care)? Had it been from other than Allah they would surely have found therein much discrepancy).Why would we have to find much discrepancy in a book to know that it’s not from Allah? why not some discrepancy or little discrepancy? It’s as if the Quran is saying you might find a few errors and contradictions in the Quran but you know it’s the word of Allah as you don’t find much discrepancy.Answer : Again a straw-man argument. Allah didn’t say you have to find much discrepancy in the Quran and if you find a little it’s OK !!! What’s the main point here? the creator whether its God or anyone else. Allah tells us if someone made the Quran other than Allah people would have discovered plenty of errors in it. He didn’t mention that the Quran contains some errors!! where did this man get that from?. If anyone brought me a single verse stating that i will leave Islam immediately because i will be convinced that it’s not from God. This man twists the verses and then try to criticize them.How long did it take Allah to create the universe? according to Surah 7 verse 54 it took 6 days. According to Surah 41 verses 9–12 it took 8 days.Answer : I can’t believe that there are still people who stir these topics after they were made clear over and over again. I will answer them nonetheless. He says there are contradiction between Surah 7 and Surah 41. I will quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 7 verse 54 : “Indeed your Lord is Allah who created the heavens and earth in six days and then established Himself above the Throne. He covers the night with the day [another night] chasing it rapidly; and [He created] the sun the moon and the stars subjected by His command. Unquestionably His is the creation and the command; blessed is Allah Lord of the worlds.” Surah 41 verses 9–12 : “Say ""Do you indeed disbelieve in He who created the earth in two days and attribute to Him equals? That is the Lord of the worlds ۞ And He placed on the earth firmly set mountains over its surface and He blessed it and determined therein its [creatures'] sustenance in four days without distinction - for [the information] of those who ask ۞ Then He directed Himself to the heaven while it was smoke and said to it and to the earth ""Come [into being] willingly or by compulsion."" They said ""We have come willingly ۞ And He completed them as seven heavens within two days and inspired in each heaven its command. And We adorned the nearest heaven with lamps and as protection. That is the determination of the Exalted in Might the Knowing.” There is no contradiction between the time period mentioned in these verses and the other verse which says that it was six days. In these verses – from Surah 41 – we see that Allah is telling us that He “created the earth in two Days”. Then He “placed therein (i.e. the earth) firm mountains from above it and He blessed it and measured therein its sustenance (for its dwellers)” in four days equal– i.e. in two days that were added to the two days in which He created the earth so the total is four days. It does not say that the creation of the mountains and the measuring of the sustenance took four days. Perhaps the confusion which is mentioned in the question stems from this i.e. from thinking that the four days are added to the two days in which the earth was created equaling six and then adding the two days in which the heavens were created (“Then He completed and finished from their creation (as) seven heavens in two Days”) – making a total of eight days not six days. But this confusion can be dispelled by dealing with this mistaken notion. So the earth was created in two days and the mountains were created and the sustenance measured in two more days which makes a total of four i.e. this took the other two days. Then the creation of the seven heavens took two days. So the total is six days of the Days of Allah may He be glorified and exalted. (not like ordinary days) The interpreters commented on this fact which deals with the mistaken notion. Imam Al-Qurtubi said: “in four days” – this is like someone saying “I set out from Basra to Baghdad in ten days and to Kufa in fifteen days i.e. a total time of fifteen days.” (al-Jaami’ li Ahkaam al-Qur’aan vol. 15 p. 343). Imam Al-Baghawi said: “in four days” means the creation of what is in the earth. The measuring of the sustenance was on Tuesday and Wednesday which along with Sunday and Monday add up to four days. This is like saying “I married a woman yesterday and today I married two” – one of whom is the woman whom he married the day before. (Tafseer al-Baghawi 7/165 ) Imam Al-Zajjaaj said: “in four days” means two days added to the previous two days. (Al-Kashshaaf vol. 3 p. 444) These verses – from Surah 41 – confirm the other verse which says that the creation of the heavens and the earth was completed in six days. So there is no contradiction concerning the period in which Allah created the heavens and the earth. There cannot be any such contradictions in the Quran.What did Allah create first the heavens or the earth? According to Surah 2 verse 29 the earth was created first then the heavens. According to Surah 79 verses 27–30 the heavens were created first then the earth.Answer : I will quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 2 verse 29 : “It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth. Then He directed Himself to the heaven [His being above all creation] and made them seven heavens and He is Knowing of all things” Surah 79 verses 27–30 : “Are you a more difficult creation or is the heaven? Allah constructed it ۞ He raised its ceiling and proportioned it ۞ And He darkened its night and extracted its brightness ۞ And after that He spread the earth.” So the earth was created first not spread then the heaven was created then the earth was spread by bringing forth water and pasture from it i.e. trees crops and so on. What is meant by the words of Allah may He be exalted “He it is Who created for you all that is on earth” [Surah 2 verse 239] is the earth itself and He measured out what would be upon it of provision and other things. The word “khalaqa” (translated as created) here means measured. This is in accordance with the words in Surah 41: “and measured [qaddara] therein its sustenance” [Surah 41 verse 10]. Imam Muhammad al-Ameen ash-Shinqeeti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: First of all it should be understood that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) was asked about reconciling between the verse in Surah 41 and the verse in Surah 79 and he responded by saying that Allah may He be exalted created the earth first before the heaven but it was not spread. Then He rose over towards the heaven and fashioned it as seven heavens in two days then He spread the earth after that and placed in it mountains rivers and so on. So the creation of the earth itself came before the creation of the heavens and then came the spreading of the earth with its mountains trees and so on after the creation of the heavens. This is indicated by the fact that He says: “And after that He spread the earth” [Surah 79 verse 30] and He did not say that He created it. Then He explained what is meant by spreading it by saying: “And brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture” [Surah 79 verse 31 which he didn’t mention intentionally]. The way in which Ibn ‘Abbaas reconciled between these two verses is clear and there is no problem with it as may be understood from the apparent meaning of the Holy Quran. End quote. Then he mentioned the verse in Surah 2 and explained that what is meant by creation there is measuring or creating the earth itself. He also mentioned another way of reconciling between the verses which is that the verse “And after that He spread the earth” [Surah 79 verse 30] means with that So the word ba‘d (translated here as “after”) may mean ma‘a “with”. This reconciliation may be supported by an odd mode of recitation according to which Mujaahid recited it as wa’l-arda ma‘a dhalika dahaahaa [instead of wa’l-arda ba‘da dhalika dahaahaa]. Based on this mode of recitation the verse in Surah 79 does not mention the order in which the heavens and the earth were created therefore there is no contradiction between it and the verses in Surah 2 and and Surah 41. See: Daf‘ Eehaam al-Idtiraab ‘an Aayaat al-Kitaab by al-‘Allaamah Muhammad al-Ameen ash-Shinqeeti printed with his tafseer Adwa’ al-Bayaan (10/16-18).Who was the first Muslim? In Surah 6 verse 14 it’s Muahmmed “Peace be upon him”. Surah 7 verse 143 it’s Moses “Peace be upon him”. Yet the Quran also claims that Adam “Peace be upon him” and Abraham “Peace be upon him” were Muslims.Answer : Let’s start with Etymology first; Islam (Arabic: إسلام‎ is a verbal noun originating from the triliteral root (S-L-M) which forms a large class of words mostly relating to concepts of wholeness submission safeness and peace. In a religious context it means ""voluntary submission to God"". Islām is the verbal noun of Form IV of the root and means ""submission"" or ""surrender"". Muslim the word for an adherent of Islam is the active participle of the same verb form and means ""submitter"" or ""one who surrenders"". The word sometimes has distinct connotations in its various occurrences in the Quran. In some verses there is stress on the quality of Islam as an internal spiritual state: ""Whomsoever God desires to guide He opens his heart to Islam."" Quran 6:125 Quran 61:7 Quran 39:22 Other verses connect Islam and religion (dīn) together: ""Today I have perfected your religion (dīn) for you; I have completed My blessing upon you; I have approved Islam for your religion."" Quran 5:3 Quran 3:19 Quran 3:83 Still others describe Islam as an action of returning to God—more than just a verbal affirmation of faith. In the Hadith of Gabriel islām is presented as one part of a triad that also includes imān (faith) and ihsān (excellence). Now let’s quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 6 verse 14 : “Say ""Is it other than Allah I should take as a protector Creator of the heavens and the earth while it is He who feeds and is not fed?"" Say [O Muhammad] ""Indeed I have been commanded to be the first [among you] who submit [to Allah ] and [was commanded] 'Do not ever be of the polytheists” Surah 7 verse 143 : “And when Moses arrived at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him he said ""My Lord show me [Yourself] that I may look at You."" [ Allah ] said ""You will not see Me but look at the mountain; if it should remain in place then you will see Me."" But when his Lord appeared to the mountain He rendered it level and Moses fell unconscious. And when he awoke he said ""Exalted are You! I have repented to You and I am the first of the believers.” I am very happy that he mentioned these two verses in particular. In Surah 6 the word is “Awwala Mn Aslama” which means the first one to submit to God. Whereas in Surah 7 it’s “Awwala Al-Mu’meneen” → The first of the believers (not a Muslim as following the religion of Islam). A complete lie !First Prophet in Arabia? In Surah 2 verses 125–129 It’s Abraham “Peace be upon him” and Ishmael “Peace be upon him” when they built the Kaa’ba. Yet in Surah 28 verse 46 it claims that Muhammed “Peace be upon him” was the first messenger to come to the Arabs.Answer : I will quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 2 verses 125–129 : “And [mention] when We made the House a place of return for the people and [a place of] security. And take [O believers] from the standing place of Abraham a place of prayer. And We charged Abraham and Ishmael [saying] ""Purify My House for those who perform Tawaf and those who are staying [there] for worship and those who bow and prostrate [in prayer] ۞ And [mention] when Abraham said ""My Lord make this a secure city and provide its people with fruits - whoever of them believes in Allah and the Last Day."" [ Allah ] said. ""And whoever disbelieves - I will grant him enjoyment for a little; then I will force him to the punishment of the Fire and wretched is the destination ۞ And [mention] when Abraham was raising the foundations of the House and [with him] Ishmael [saying] ""Our Lord accept [this] from us. Indeed You are the Hearing the Knowing ۞ Our Lord and make us Muslims [in submission] to You and from our descendants a Muslim nation [in submission] to You. And show us our rites and accept our repentance. Indeed You are the Accepting of repentance the Merciful ۞ Our Lord and send among them a messenger from themselves who will recite to them Your verses and teach them the Book and wisdom and purify them. Indeed You are the Exalted in Might the Wise” Surah 28 verse 46 : “And you were not at the side of the mount when We called [Moses] but [were sent] as a mercy from your Lord to warn a people to whom no warner had come before you that they might be reminded” Now the answer lies exactly in these two examples he cited. When we check the last verse of the first example (i.e. Surah 2 verse 129) we find that both Abraham “Peace be upon him” and Ishmael “Peace be upon him” were asking God to send a messenger for these people “i.e. the Arabs” from their own as stated clearly : “Our Lord and send among them a messenger from themselves who will recite to them Your verses and teach them the Book and wisdom and purify them. Indeed You are the Exalted in Might the Wise”. The other thing is that both Abraham “Peace be upon him” and Ishmael “Peace be upon him” were there in Arabia not for preaching but for building the Kaaba also as stated clearly. I wait for him to provide one verse in the whole Quran where God tells us that Abraham “peace be upon him” or Ishmael “peace be upon him” were messengers to the Arabs.According to Surah 4 verse 28 committing Shirk* (i.e. association with God in worship) is unforgivable. Later in the Same Surah 4 verse 153 Allah forgives people for committing Shirk.Answer : I will quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 4 verse 48 : “Indeed Allah does not forgive association with Him but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allah has certainly fabricated a tremendous sin” Surah 4 verse 153 : “The People of the Scripture ask you to bring down to them a book from the heaven. But they had asked of Moses [even] greater than that and said ""Show us Allah outright"" so the thunderbolt struck them for their wrongdoing. Then they took the calf [for worship] after clear evidences had come to them and We pardoned that. And We gave Moses a clear authority” There is something very important this man doesn’t mention deliberately; There is a clear distinction between dying while you worship someone with God and refusing his signs to you and repenting before you die and returning to the one true God with no association with anyone or anything else. He needs to study more “Aqida” or Islamic Creed. How to make sure that God means that? Let’s cite this part from another Surah and see : Surah 7 verses 148 - 153 : “And the people of Moses made after [his departure] from their ornaments a calf - an image having a lowing sound. Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to a way? They took it [for worship] and they were wrongdoers ۞ And when regret overcame them and they saw that they had gone astray they said ""If our Lord does not have mercy upon us and forgive us we will surely be among the losers ۞ And when Moses returned to his people angry and grieved he said ""How wretched is that by which you have replaced me after [my departure]. Were you impatient over the matter of your Lord?"" And he threw down the tablets and seized his brother by [the hair of] his head pulling him toward him. [Aaron] said ""O son of my mother indeed the people oppressed me and were about to kill me so let not the enemies rejoice over me and do not place me among the wrongdoing people ۞ [Moses] said ""My Lord forgive me and my brother and admit us into Your mercy for You are the most merciful of the merciful ۞ Indeed those who took the calf [for worship] will obtain anger from their Lord and humiliation in the life of this world and thus do We recompense the inventors [of falsehood] ۞ But those who committed misdeeds and then repented after them and believed - indeed your Lord thereafter is Forgiving and Merciful” Do you see? What if they died in disbelieve or in Shirk?The answer is in Surah 2 verses 161–162 : “Indeed those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers - upon them will be the curse of Allah and of the angels and the people all together ۞ Abiding eternally therein. The punishment will not be lightened for them nor will they be reprieved”Quran in pure Arabic. Surah 16 verse 103 tells us that the Quran is written in pure Arabic. And yet there are many foreign words in the Quran.Answer : Where are the examples of those “foreign words”? he didn’t mention any!!Surah 2 verse 62 Says that Jews and Christians don’t need to fear because we will be accepted by Allah. Surah 3 verse 85 says that the only religion accepted by Allah is Islam.Answer : I will quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 2 verse 62 : “Indeed those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans [before Prophet Muhammad] - those [among them] who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteousness - will have their reward with their Lord and no fear will there be concerning them nor will they grieve.” Surah 3 verse 85 : “And whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him and he in the Hereafter will be among the losers” In order to understand these verses correctly we need to refer to the scholars of Tafseer (Qur’anic commentary). The great Imaam Ismaa’eel ibn Katheer may Allah have mercy on him said in his tafseer of the verse from Surah 2: “Allah may He be exalted points out that whoever of the previous nations did well and was obedient will have a good reward and this will be the case for everyone who follows the Unlettered Prophet [Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) until the Hour comes – he will have eternal happiness and they will not fear what they are going to face nor will they grieve for what they have left behind. As Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘No doubt! Verily the awliya’ of Allah [i.e. those who believe in the Oneness of Allah and fear Allah much and love Allah much] no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve.’ [Surah 10 verse 62]. And Allah tells us what the angels say to the believers at the time of death (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Verily those who say “Our Lord is Allah” then they istaqaamu [stood straight i.e. truly followed Islam] on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): “Fear not nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised!”’ [Surah 41 verse 30] As far as the Jews are concerning their faith meant believing in the Tawraat (original Torah) and following the way of Moses (peace be upon him) until ‘Eesa “i.e. Jesus” (peace be upon him) - came after which whoever continued to follow the Torah and the way of Moses and did not leave this and follow Jesus was doomed. As far as the Christians are concerned their faith meant believing in the Injeel (original Gospel) and following the laws of Jesus (peace be upon him); whoever did this was a believer whose faith was acceptable to Allah until Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came after which whoever did not follow Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and leave the way of Jesus (peace be upon him) and the Gospel that he had been following before was doomed. The verse (interpretation of the meaning) “And whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him and he in the Hereafter will be among the losers” [Surah 3 verse 85] is a statement that Allah will not accept any way or deed from anyone after sending His Final Messenger except those that are in accordance with the laws of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Prior to this however anyone who followed the Prophet of his own time was on the Straight Path of salvation. So the Jews were those who followed Moses (peace be upon him) and referred to the Torah for judgement at that time. When Allah sent Jesus (peace be upon him) the Children of Israel were obliged to follow him and obey him and so they and others who followed him became Christians.. When Allaah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as the Final Prophet and a Messenger to all the children of Adam all of mankind was obliged to believe in him and obey him and refrain from what he prohibited. Those who did so are the true believers. The ummah (nation) of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) are called the believers because of their deep eemaan (faith) and conviction and because they believe in all the past Prophets and in the prophesied events that are yet to come.” Commenting on the verse in Surah 2 verse 62 “Indeed those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans [before Prophet Muhammad] - those [among them] who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteousness - will have their reward with their Lord and no fear will there be concerning them nor will they grieve.” Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “What is meant is that every group believed in Allah and the Last Day which is the appointed Day of Reckoning and did righteous deeds. But after Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sent to both mankind and the jinn true belief can only be in accordance with the way of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Whoever follows his way will not fear the future or grieve for what they leave behind.” I guess it’s pretty obvious in the verse itself when God says “Indeed those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans [before Prophet Muhammad] - those [among them] who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteousness - will have their reward with their Lord and no fear will there be concerning them nor will they grieve.”. Do Christians and Jews believe in Allah now? They curse him!What is man created from? Surah 19 verse 67 says that man was created from nothing. Surah 96 verse 2 Says that man was created from a clot of blood. Surah 21 verse 30 Says that man was created from water. Surah 16 verse 4 Says that man was created from small seed. Surah 15 verse 26 Says that man was created from Clay and Mud. Surah 3 verse 59 Says that man was created from Dust. Surah 11 verse 61 Says that man was created from Earth.Answer : I will quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 19 verse 67 : “Does man not remember that We created him before while he was nothing?” Surah 96 verse 2 : “Created man from a clinging substance (i.e. clot)” Surah 21 verse 30 : “Have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity and We separated them and made from water every living thing? Then will they not believe?” Surah 16 verse 4 : “He created man from a sperm-drop; then at once he is a clear adversary” Surah 15 verse 26 : “And We did certainly create man out of clay from an altered black mud” Surah 3 verse 59 : “Indeed the example of Jesus to Allah is like that of Adam. He created Him from dust; then He said to him ""Be"" and he was” Surah 11 verse 61 : “And to Thamud [We sent] their brother Salih. He said ""O my people worship Allah ; you have no deity other than Him. He has produced you from the earth and settled you in it so ask forgiveness of Him and then repent to Him. Indeed my Lord is near and responsive” From all the points he stirred i guess this one is the most stupid one till now. (Mud is in earth and Mud = Dust + Water. This is the origin of the creation then the progeny comes from sperm which starts to form a clot..etc) where is the contradiction here? Not to mention his poor quoting skills. Instead of Sperm he calls it “small seed”!!? Instead of saying (We created him before while he was nothing?) he says (Created from nothing) as if nothing is the building block of humans !! I will quote a verse he didn’t quote because it explains the creation of a baby in his mother’s womb : Surah 23 verses 12–14 “And certainly did We create man from an extract of clay ۞ Then We placed him as a sperm-drop in a firm lodging ۞ Then We made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot and We made the clot into a lump [of flesh] and We made [from] the lump bones and We covered the bones with flesh; then We developed him into another creation. So blessed is Allah the best of creators” As for the creation of Adam “Peace be upon him”. Surah 38 verse 71 “[So mention] when your Lord said to the angels ""Indeed I am going to create a human being from clay” As you can see no contradiction just more details in some verses.Will intercession be possible in the day of judgemen? According to Surah 20 verse 109 Surah 34 verse 23 and Surah 43 verse 86 → Yes. According to Surah 2 verse 123 Surah 6 verse 51 and Surah 82 verse 19 —-> No.Answer : I will quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 20 verse 109 : “That Day no intercession will benefit except [that of] one to whom the Most Merciful has given permission and has accepted his word” Surah 34 verse 23 : “And intercession does not benefit with Him except for one whom He permits. [And those wait] until when terror is removed from their hearts they will say [to one another] ""What has your Lord said?"" They will say ""The truth."" And He is the Most High the Grand” Surah 43 verse 86 : “And those they invoke besides Him do not possess [power of] intercession; but only those who testify to the truth [can benefit] and they know” Surah 2 verse 123 : “And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all and no compensation will be accepted from it nor will any intercession benefit it nor will they be aided” Surah 6 verse 51 : “And warn by the Qur'an those who fear that they will be gathered before their Lord - for them besides Him will be no protector and no intercessor - that they might become righteous” Surah 82 verse 19 : “It is the Day when a soul will not possess for another soul [power to do] a thing; and the command that Day is [entirely] with Allah” In Islam Intercession is accepted from Muslims only. And Good Muslims in particular who reached high degrees of piety. Intercession will be for Muslims in Hellfire in order to ask God to get them out of it. Non-believers will not be granted the right to intercede or will they benefit from intercession at all. Where is the contradiction here? (Believer → Intercession / Non-believer → No intercession) It’s quite simple. In the first 3 examples (i.e. verses) God tells us that no one will be able to intercede except those who God approves. I will detail the second 3 verses which he claims denying intercession at all : Surah 2 verse 123: Here God is talking to the Children of Israel (not to mankind in general). We can know that from the previous verse 122 : “O Children of Israel remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the worlds” So to read them together : “O Children of Israel remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the worlds ۞ And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all and no compensation will be accepted from it nor will any intercession benefit it nor will they be aided” Surah 2 verses 122–123 Surah 6 verse 51: Here God tells the Prophet (peace be upon him) to warn the people and incite them to be righteous by telling them that if they disbelieve they will have no protector or intercessor. Te witness here is the phrase “..that they might become righteous” In other words it’s “Make them fear from that fate that they might become righteous”. Surah 82 verse 19: It’s not related to intercession. It states a fact that no soul will have any power to direct another soul to paradise or hell. Everything is/ will be in God’s power.What happened to pharaoh? According to Surah 10 verse 92; Allah saved him. According to Surah 17 verse 103 says that he drowned.Answer : I will quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 10 verse 92: “So today We will save you in body that you may be to those who succeed you a sign. And indeed many among the people of Our signs are heedless” Surah 17 verse 103: “So he intended to drive them from the land but We drowned him and those with him all together” As you can see this man is a complete idiot. He can’t even understand basic words. In the first Surah God tells us that he will save his body to be a sign for God’s wrath for those who will come after him. Was he spared punishment and drowning? No but unlike his soldiers his body was found and mummified.He talks about abrogation in the Quran which is a highly disputed topic. He says in Surah 2 verse 256 “there is no compulsion in religion”. Whereas Surah 9 verse 29 says “Fight those who don’t believe in Allah”.Answer : I will quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 2 verse 256: “There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong. So whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing” Surah 9 verse 29: “Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the Scripture - [fight] until they give the jizyah willingly while they are humbled” I guess first verse is no problem for him. He talks about the second one about fighting. All interpreters of the Quran Islamic Historians Jurists and Biographers agree that this verse in particular was a divine command to fight the Byzantines because they killed a companion of the Prophet who was sent with a message to them. So it’s not a general rule. Here in Egypt we don’t fight Coptic Christians for example!!. But i will assume that it’s a general rule for his sake. Where in that verse does it command us to force convert people? It clearly says fight to take tribute from the not to make them Muslims!.Is a Muslim allowed to drink alcohol? According to Surah 4 verse 43: Yes. According to Surah 5 verse 90: No.Answer : I will quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 4 verse 43 : “O you who have believed do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you are saying or in a state of janabah except those passing through [a place of prayer] until you have washed [your whole body]. And if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the place of relieving himself or you have contacted women and find no water then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and your hands [with it]. Indeed Allah is ever Pardoning and Forgiving” Surah 5 verse 90 : “O you who have believed indeed intoxicants gambling [sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than Allah ] and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan so avoid it that you may be successful” I feel complete retardness when i answer such well-known questions! But i have to because some people don’t know Islam that much. Anyway The Quran was revealed to the Prophet (peace be upon him) along 23 years approximately. Some rulings were stated and applied gradually because people couldn’t indulge in religion so fast. So for example the Muslim prayer started as a regular prayer to God to ask him for guidance and it was twice a day. The same happened with alcohol. Arabs used to drink so many sorts of alcohol and mention it in their poems..etc. It was an integrated part of their meetings. So when God wanted us to stop alcohol he instructed us in a gradual way in order not to make it hard on people. So the first verse this guy mention is at the beginning of the ban. God tells us not to come to prayer while drunk. Which means 5 times a day you can’t be drunk. Then in the second verse he tells us to stop totally and it was after they followed the first order to be sober nearly more than half the day.What is the penalty for sexual sin? Surah 4 verse 15 tells us it’s house arrest while Surah 24 verse 2 tells us 100 lashes.Answer : I will quote the interpretation of the meaning of these verses in question from the website Al-Qur'an al-Kareem - القرآن الكريم : Surah 4 verse 15 : “Those who commit unlawful sexual intercourse of your women - bring against them four [witnesses] from among you. And if they testify confine the guilty women to houses until death takes them or Allah ordains for them [another] way” Surah 24 verse 2 : “The woman or man found guilty of sexual intercourse - lash each one of them with a hundred lashes and do not be taken by pity for them in the religion of Allah if you should believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a group of the believers witness their punishment” The first verse he mentions is about Lesbians not adultery or fornication. Whereas the second verse is about Adultery/Fornication.Done Alhamdoullillah and Allah knows best.",Mohammed Said,https://www.quora.com/profile/Mohammed-Said-161

Treta Yug age is 1296000 Years and Dwapar Yug age is 864000 Years and Lord Sri Ram had appeared at the end of Treta Yug and Sri Krishna also appeared in the end of Dwpar Yug. Kalyug arrival date is same the day Lord Sri Krishna left this material world for his abode Param Dham. Age of Kalyug is 432000 years and out of total age its only passed about 6000 years now the mathematics is just visible before you. You can calculate now easily how much time is passed since Lord Ram left the world. So as Per Hindu literature age of Ramayan Period is almost about over 1200000 years and Mahabharat age is about 6000 years. During this period neither any Science nor any history was ever available. Scientist of US has also estimated the age of Ram Setu on ocean as about over 1000000 Years and Ram Setu was man made first Setu of the world is also proved. This news was already published in Indian News paper. So exaect date of Ramayan and Mahabahrat is beyond of Scientist of present time. It can be known or noted by the consulting Hindu literature only. /Jai Sri Ram/,Virendra Kumar Sharma,https://www.quora.com/profile/Virendra-Kumar-Sharma

How is Lord Krishna having so many wives and girlfriends justified in Mahabharata?,https://www.quora.com/How-is-Lord-Krishna-having-so-many-wives-and-girlfriends-justified-in-Mahabharata,,As per Mahabharata Krishna had a total of 16108 wives of which eight were his principle wives and they are Rukmini Satyabhama Jambavati Kalindi Mitravrinda Nagnajiti Bhadra and Lakshana. The other 16100 were rescued from Narakasura where they had been forcibly kept. These women were in disgrace because they had lived with the demon king and none of their families would accept them. So Krishna gave these women the status of his wives. This marital status was not for sexual pleasure but to give them shelter and a respectful place in the society. Lord Krishna's marriage with 16100 wives was synonymous to raas leela where he danced with 108 gopis at the same time while each gopi believed he was dancing only with her. Whole life Krishna manifested in 16108 forms to share same love and care to all his wives.,Vipul Hadiya,https://www.quora.com/profile/Vipul-Hadiya

Before that a quick heads up is that I will exclusively be quoting from Mahabharata and Valmiki Ramayana I will not be using any other scriptures to prove my points.Mahabharata and Valmiki Ramayana are what is known as ""Itihaas"" in Santana Dharma i.e. these texts describe the events which happened in our own timeline or Kalpa. Puranas contain loads of things which have happened in different timelines or Kalpas and there are many different forms of Ramayana like Ananda Ramayana Adbhut Ramayana Vilanka Ramayana and many more alongside Ramcharitmanas (all of which contain stories from different Kalpas). But Valmiki Ramayana and Vyas Mahabharata contain the events which have happened exactly in Vaivasvata Manvantara of Shweta Varaha Kalpa which is our current timeline. So quoting from them provides scenarios which have happened in our exact past. Alright so firstly people think that Lord Rama ""unfairly"" killed Vali and because of that he gave him a ""promise"" that he will die in an ""unfair"" manner at the hands of Vali in his next birth. This is the seed of the Jara story but let's see what Valmiki Ramayana says about the encounter between Vali and Lord Rama. So Sugriva and Vali started to fight : Those two Vali and Sugreeva with their sensational energy triumphing zeal frightful physiques swiftness as good as the Divine Eagle Garuda vigilance in exploring perilous body parts of one another ravagement of their own enemies fought frighteningly like the sun and moon in the sky which is inconceivable. But Vali being the possessor of might and vigour progressed and though greatly mighty is son of sun Sugreeva regressed. (Valmiki Ramayana Kishkindha Kanda Sarga 16 ) After this Lord Rama informed of his presence to Vali and warned him as followsThen on tautening a venomous serpent like arrow in the bow Rama started to draw out bowstring whereby that bow attained a similitude with the Time-disc of the Terminator. At the blast of bowstring the lordly birds and animals are panicked like those that will be startled by the approach of ear ending and they all fled.(Valmiki Ramayana Kishkindha Kanda Sarga 16 ) This warning by Lord Rama can be interpreted as the last chance provided by the Lord to Vali to repent for his mistakes and stop fighting Sugriva immediately and make up with him once again. Knowing the benevolent Lord he would have even forgiven Vali and would have convinced Sugriva to forgive him as well. But alas Vali did not take the warning seriously and instead threw very large trees and rocks at the Lord who then countered them with an amazing arrow ""Shattering trees and massive boulders that Vali hurled at him with thunderbolt like arrows Rama felled Vali as if by a thunderbolt. (Valmiki Ramayana Kishkindha Kanda Sarga 16 ) This goes to show that when Lord Rama shot an arrow to Vali to counter the attack of Vali on himself and that when Lord Rama shot the arrow Vali's focus was on Lord Rama. This clearly goes to show that Lord Rama did not kill Vali unfairly in the battle rather he : 1) Firstly warned Vali which was an indication for him to stop the fight and give him the final chance to repent his mistakes 2) Secondly when Lord Rama eventually shot the arrow on Vali it was to counter Vali's own attack on himself and that Vali was fully aware of Lord Rama's presence and was focused on attacking Lord Rama when he was shot. So this clears the doubts on ""Vali's unfair death"". Now let's see how Lord Krishna departed the material world. The first point to make here is that let alone the hunter Jara no one in all the worlds has the power to even harm Lord Krishna leave aside even the prospect of ""killing"" Lord Krishna. And this is not something I'm saying because of my personal fascination and love for Shri Krishna but this is exactly what Lord Shiva himself has said about him! To slay Bana Achyuta again wished to hurl the chakra. However with Kumara Mahadeva arrived before him and said “O Krishna! O great god! O Purushottama! O Krishna! I know you. You are the one who killed Madhu and Kaitabha. You are the eternal god of the gods. O god! You are the destination of the worlds. The universe has been generated from you. The three worlds with the gods the asuras and humans cannot vanquish you. Therefore withdraw the divine chakra that you have raised. It is terrible towards enemies and will certainly destroy everything in this battle. O slayer of Keshi! I have granted Bana freedom from fear. You should pardon me. Source: Vishnu Parva Chapter 112 Harivamsha Mahabharta Lord Shiva himself says that Lord Krishna cannot be vanquished by all Gods and Asuras combined. So this makes it clear that no one can hurt Lord Krishna let alone “kill” him. Furthermore Mahabharata also says that Lord Krishna is the beginning end and middle of everything and everything rests upon him alone. He is the clouds and lightning and everything else. He is Airavata. Everything mobile and immobile is Krishna. He is famous in the universe. Know him to be Vishnu. He is the abode of the universe. He is devoid of qualities. He is Vasudeva. As life in creatures he is Samkarshana and is worshipped. He is Pradyumna. He is Aniruddha in his fourth form. From his own self the great-souled one manifested himself to us in these forms. Desiring to create this universe with its five kinds of beings he divided himself into five elements. O Partha! He thus created earth wind space light and water. He created mobile and immobile objects and the four kinds of beings.He created the earth and sowed the five kinds of seed.He created the firmament so that it could shower down on earth. O king! He created the universe. It is he who created all creatures from his own self. The lord of creatures always desires to create and brought together everything—the gods the asuras men the worlds the rishis the ancestors and the subjects. Know that everything good and bad mobile and immobile— flows from Vishvaksena. Everything that exists and everything that will exist —know that everything flows from Keshava. When it is time for creatures to die and the time of destruction presents itself it is Krishna who is the eternal and direct conveyor of dharma. Know that every creature in the universe and everything else originates in Vishvaksena. Everything that is praised in this world everything auspicious everything good and bad is Keshava who is himself inconceivable. There is no reason to hold an opposite view. Keshava is like this. He is Svayambhu. He is the supreme and undecaying Narayana. He is the beginning and the end of all creatures and he is also their middle. The universe vests in him.”’ ~Bori CE Mahabharata section 1823(143) Lord Krishna is further praised as the Supreme being and the Supreme god the ultimate refuge of the whole world too O Partha! Let Krishna instruct you about what remains. I know the truth about Krishna and about his ancient strength. O Indra among Kouravas! Keshava is immeasurable in his soul. He will speak to you about doubts on dharma. Krishna created the earth the sky and heaven. Terrible in his strength he is the ancient boar. The firmament heaven the four directions and the four sub-directions are subservient to him. Everything in this ancient universe was created by him and originates in him. He is without a sense of ownership. A lotus was generated from his navel and the infinitely energetic Svayambhu emerged from that. O Partha! It is he who dispelled that terrible 0darkness which pervaded the primeval ocean. He existed in the form of all the dharma in krita yuga. In treta yuga he existed in the form of knowledge. O Partha! In dvapara yuga Krishna exists in the form of strength. In kali yuga he will be on earth in the form of adharma. He is the god who slew the daityas earlier. He is the ancient god who became an emperor. He is the creator of beings. He is the creator of future beings. He is the protector of the world and the universe. When dharma suffers Krishna is born among gods and men. Cleansed in his soul and based on dharma he establishes the superior and the inferior worlds. Sparing those who should be spared he slays the asuras. O Partha! He is good and bad deeds and their reason. The god does what needs to be done. He is also what will be done. Again know that he is Soma and Shakra. He is Vishvakarma. He is the one who has the universe as his form. He brings prosperity to the universe. He is the one who destroys the universe. He wields the trident. He is covered in blood. He is fierce. He is known by his deeds and everyone praises him. The gandharvas the apsaras and hundreds of gods always worship him. The rakshasas bear him. He is the bringer of prosperity. He alone is the victorious one. He is honoured and praised in the sacrifices. He is praised in the rathantara hymns of the Sama Veda. The brahmanas praise him in mantras about the brahman. It is to him that the officiating priests offer oblations. He is the ancient Brahma shrouded in mystery. ~Bori CE Mahabharata section 1823(143)Furthermore throughout the course of his life Lord Krishna was unscathed and completely neutralized supreme weapons like Vaishnavastra Pashupatastra and Brahma astras of different kinds too. Vaishnavastra became a garland when it was received on the chest of Lord Krishna !Having been thus pierced and pained he angrily resorted to the vaishnava weapon. He invoked the mantra on his goad and hurled it towards Pandava’s chest. That weapon was capable of slaying everything and was released by Bhagadatta. Covering Partha Keshava received it on his own chest. On Keshava’s chest that weapon became the vaijayanti garland.Samshaptaka-Vadha ParvaChapter 1005(28)BORI CE Mahābhārata So what makes one think that some random hunter can kill him with a simple arrow? But still let's see what Mahabharata says about Lord Krishna leaving the mortal worldhe hunter saw a man immersed in yoga with many arms and attired in yellow garments. He thought he had committed a grave sin and severely distressed touched his feet with his head. The great-souled one comforted him. Enveloping heaven and earth in his prosperity he rose upwards. He reached heaven and was welcomed by Vasava the Ashvins Rudra the Adityas the Vasus the Vishvadevas the sages the siddhas the foremost among gandharvas and the apsaras. O king! Then the fiercely energetic powerful undecaying great-souled and illustrious Narayana went to his own region which is impossible to fathom.Source : Mausala ParvaChapter 1983(5)BORI CE MahābhārataSo Lord Krishna did not ""die"" or leave the mortal world because of being ""wounded"" by a random hunter but he merely assumed his original four armed Vishnu form (just like Lord Rama at Sarayu) and left to his eternal abode of Vaikuntha because the purpose of his incarnation was complete. Again note the word ""undecaying"" used for Narayana ( Krishna ) and again understand that this is the supreme soul you are talking about he's impossible to ""kill"" Hope this answer goes out to clear a lot of misconceptions both Hindus and Non-Hindus have about Lord Krishna's departure and Lord Rama's fight with Vali.JAI SHREE LAXMINARAYAN PRABHU JI !",Oem Trivedi,https://www.quora.com/profile/Oem-Trivedi

Even in the 21st century shudras can not become temple priests. Lower caste Hindus who convert to Islam or Christianity to escape the stigma of caste system or denied benefits of reservation by the Indian state. Upper caste Hindus stay away from marrying spouses from lower castes regardless of social status. Many Indian states have enacted anti conversion laws to prevent conversion of Hindus to other religions and made conversion a criminal offence.

Even the most glorified women in Mahabharata like Draupadi and Kuntihave more than one partners. In contrast the ones that are defeated and slain in Kurukshetra- Bhishma DronaKarna were either unmarried or had a single wife. In Ramayana Rama is forced to abide by the law of the land and exile his innocent wife who had been abducted by deception. In Mahabharata Krishna encourages Arjuna to abduct Subhadra defying all norms and decorums of the society. In Ramayana Ahalya is turned to stone because she unknowingly accepts overtures from Indra in disguise. In Mahabharata ladies of the royal household-Ambika and Ambalika knowingly beget children with Vyasa. Conclusion Ramayana is the guiding book for an individual. It stresses on how to behave with one’s kins and strangers friends and foes. It lays down the code of conduct in an ideal society. Mahabharata disavows these norms and stresses on the importance of universal welfare. It flouts the diktat of interpersonal relationships and somewhat relieves the stress attached to them. At the same timeit diverts the attention to the greater good. So in marrying more than once Krishna signals quite early that he won't let his work get sabotaged by ideals. He puts a premium on social responsibilities over personal ones. This is a significant departure from the lofty standards of individualistic probity set by Rama. Krishna becomes defined by his work and is called ‘Leela Purushottam'  while Rama remains defined by his values and called ‘Maryada Purushottam'. Therefore Rama has one wife and he always abides by the law. But Krishna has many wives and he disregards laws whenever he finds them unfair.

Because “India” was a name given to us by the Greeks. Our own self-identity is not “India” — it is Bharatiya or any of the names above. In my heart of hearts I am not an Indian — I am a Bharatiya who follows Bharatiya samskriti. The word Hindu is used interchangeably in two ways which confuses a lot of people. Hindu (originally) is a geographical and cultural identifier of “those people beyond the Sindhu-Saraswathy river who share a common culture and common set of spiritual practices” … it was a reference to the Vedic civilization by foreigners i.e. those who traded with us called us ‘Hindu’ due to lack of certain sounds in their spoken language so the people of the Sapta-Sindhu (7 rivers) became Hapta-Hindu. This heterogenous group called Hindus included both Astikas (followers of the Vedas) and Nastikas (those who rejected the Vedas but shared almost everything else). The Astika group above are the people who mostly call themselves “Hindus” today when someone asks what religion are you? For lack of precision and a better way to explain who they are — in reality no one today has a clue about real world history only the manufactured and selective world history that is entirely euro-centric — so going around explaining what I just did is likely to fall on confused/deaf ears and lead to an infinite chain of questions. So “Hindus”.Figure: Sri Adi Shankara (Shankara BhagavadPada) who preserved/revived the ancient dharma which was under threat from various Nastika influences at the time by establishing maThas at the four corners of India all before the age of 32. He had mastered the Vedas and Vedangas at the age of 3 or 4 and by the age of 8 was writing extensive commentaries on advaitam in Samskritam. He is considered the avataara of Lord Shiva himself. He traveled on foot to the four corners of Bharatavarsha to establish the maThas/peethas that would serve as institutions to preserve the Astika sampradayas. Each institution had its own maThadhipathi who was responsible for each portion of Bharat under their guidance/protection. Shankara laid the foundations that would preserve the sanatana dharma for the next 1000 years of continuous onslaught by invasionary forces. This in concert with the continuous avataras (births) of mahapurushas (Sages Munis Siddhas Yogapurushas Bhaktas etc.) in every century from the time of Shankara Bhagavadpada has served to rejuvenate and preserve the momentum of the dharma over several generations and lifetimes preserving the practice of our dharma in its original form through the modern age. Of course under the umbrella of the Astika umbrella there are many darshanas (from ramanujam dvaitam madhvam samkhyam advaitam) each of which have their own peethas and maThadipathis etc. all of whom have contributed in various ways to the preservation of the continuity of the dharma over the millenia. However the Astika marga darshanas (paths) all fall under the umbrella of Sanatana Dharma. The Nastika darshanas do not. Astika means those who accept the Veda pramana (authority/evidence of the Vedas that That [Bramhan][paramatma] exists.). The greatest problem I have in describing these people who have taken birth and saved sanatana dharma over the millenia is in conveying just how extraordinary these individuals were. You are all familiar with the genius of Ramanujan and his importance in the world of mathematics. Imagine the genius of Ramanujan x 1000. Each of these spiritual giants had that big of an impact on the Bharatiya culture over these millenia. They saw and interacted with the devas/devatas they wrote copious philosophical treatises having such extraordinarily deep insights into the nature of reality in the form of the most devotional heart-rending poetry ever written and have revolutionized each generation going back for several thousand years. Incomparable geniuses who had direct realization of the highest truths coming from very different and disparate backgrounds — along the spectrum of paths described by Sanatana Dharma: bhakti karma and jnana margas. Each one of these people moved mountains so to speak. Their works and their legends have made their way into the smallest hamlets and villages in every corner of Bharatavarsha which is what makes this country so spiritually vibrant. People around the world are fascinated by SadhGuru for instance; but they don’t realize or know that we [Sanatana Dharma followers] have had/seen 1000s of such yogis siddhas bhaktas and other mahapurushas spanning generation after generation going back several thousand years. What SadhGuru is saying may sound original unique or different but that’s only because its the first time it is being heard in English. He hails from a very long tradition going back ages and those beings who took birth and had superconscious experiences all left their mark indelibly on this spiritual culture of Bharat. The world endlessly talks about Jesus and Mohammad thinking them to be unique or special in some way. We have had 1000s of spiritual giants (realized men women children) 10s of 1000s of miracles with 1000x more impact than either of those two that have revolutionized our culture for 1000s of years. Your 1 or 2 people with their fairly limited (and non-sensical) ideas hardly make a dent in our consciousness — one of the reasons why Christianity and Islam have failed to take hold in India for the last thousand years and why they never will. Our dharma has always thrived on the living Truth that takes birth time and time again to inject new life and momentum to a very ancient dharma. The difference is that the Abrahamic religions are good at marketing; we are not. I am not here to brag or gloat; what i’m trying to convey to you is that you have no idea that an entire alien race lives and breathes on the same planet as you do and have been for 1000s of years; because in your own self importance you think that you know everything there is to know — i’m telling you — what you know is hardly 1% of our civilizational history and its profound and deep impact. The “Hindu” world is so alien to the rest of these religions that truly it has no equal or comparable anywhere in the world. Indeed it is so humble and silent that it is easy to ignore and overlook — but it is everywhere and yet so silently nowhere. But its impact on this world would be earth-shattering if more widely understood.

He is Ramanuja’s nephew born to Ramanuja’s younger sister Bhooma. Mudaliandan had the great fortune of being named by Ramanuja himself.Koorathazhwar alias Srivatsanga. He was born to a wealthy Brahmin/Zamindar family of then but left all his possessions behind to do service to his Acharya along with his wife Andal. The two were renowned for the administration of Srirangam temple as well as for their sons Parashara and Vedavyasa Bhattar the former of which is known to be a loved one of Ranganayaki Thayar Herself.Another famous disciple many may know of is Pillai Urangavilli Dasar or as his original name is Dhanurdasa. A famous wrestler of Srirangam town he was very much attached to his beautiful wife Ponnachi. One day while Ramanuja was walking back towards his Ashrama after a visit of Sri Ranganatha he saw Dhanurdasa walking along the opposite way holding an umbrella over Ponnachi’s eyes completely missing his own head! Ramanuja was intrigued and stopped the young man infatuated with his wife’s beauty. “Why do you shield the umbrella over her head only not covering your own?” Dhanurdasa replied with a smile “Swami my wife has the most beautiful eyes in the whole world! I don’t want them to be hurt by the harsh rays of the sun!” Ramanuja looked at the disciples around him and asked slowly “Don’t you know of the one who has much more beautiful eyes than your wife? He is in this Srirangam itself in fact. I am surprised you do not know of him.” Dhanurdasa was shocked. “Who… Who? I don’t know! In this Srirangam itself? I cannot believe this! No one has more beautiful eyes than my Ponnachi.” Ramanuja shook his head. “Come with me I will show you the Lotus-Eyed One!” And so Ramanuja took Dhanurdasa and Ponnachi with him into the sanctum sanctorum of Lord Ranganatha.One look at these eyes and Dhanurdasa fell at Ramanuja’s feet crying “Thank you thank you so much for showing me the Lord’s eyes and therefore making me subject to His grace!” He bowed low before Ramanuja “Please make me your disciple.” Ponnachi came forward too “Yes Swami. Please make me one of your disciples too.” Ramanuja very happily agreed and made the two his disciples.

Since my childhood Lord Shiva attracted me the most probably because of the mysterious stories I had heard about him.I had an impression in my mind that Lord Shiva lives in Himalayas in a human form (as we see in TV serials) but all my preconceived notions were about to get shattered.During a trekking expedition in Himalayas I met an unknown “Realised Guru” in an unexpected situation and he changed my life. Initially he appeared to me like any other man because he is not a sanyasi lives with family uses mobile phones drives a car he is young and wears urban clothes etc. But when we started to talk I realised he knows some deep secrets and he is a Himalayan Mystic. He never claimed that he was a realised being and till today he prefers to stay unknown.After the trek was over I came down to the base camp I met him again and we started the conversation in front of a bonfire.He systematically destroyed my belief system of Gods Goddesses heaven traditional mode of prayers and borrowed knowledge from books. He encouraged me to be a 'seeker' rather than a 'believer' which simply means -“Never believe in 'anything' until you experience it yourself”After that night long conversation it was clear to me that Shiva is “formless and everywhere” but I was yet to experience or feel his presence.Although I was feeling a strong attraction towards Guruji but I was still skeptical whether I should trust him because it felt like probably he knows hypnotism or something which was making my mind calm.Later on I started to visit him often and he used to teach me certain meditation techniques. I realised that in his presence when I used to meditate I used to feel an intense feeling in my spine and sometimes I used to feel mild oscillation in my body. One day I was meditating and as soon as he arrived my upper body started rotating mildly on its own as if there is some mild earthquake. After meditation I asked him why is it happening? He said:“your energies are moving upward and when you progress from one stage to another it happens. Don't bother about it and focus on the kriya.”No one is a resident meditator in his campsite because he doesn't have those facilities but we go there often for meditation camps. After many months one day after meditation session I went to him to take his blessings because I was about to leave. He was on 'silence' (Maun vrat) that day and was sitting on his chair. I touched his feet to take his blessings and sat in front of him near his feet. He looked straight in my eyes and I felt something is about to happen. It felt like his eyes were saying something that my conscious mind was not able to interpret however probably my sub conscious or unconscious mind was listening. For the first time he applied his thumb in my forehead in the Aagya chakra.I felt an electric current in my whole body and I started crying out of joy for no reason. It felt as if something was transmitted from his body to my body and that was the ‘moment’ when I came to know who he is. For that moment ‘I’ vanished and only Shiva was everywhere…literally everywhere!That was the “miracle of Shiva” when he made me realise that I was a fool to believe that I and Shiva are two separate entities.There were never two entities only he is there everywhere there is nothing except him…Later on I experienced many things which I will not reveal because certain experiences are personal and not meant to be shared. It sounds so simple but why for ‘most people' it is very difficult to realise? Because of your identities or ego - I am this I am that I like this I do not like this etc. The worst kind of identity is “I am spiritual” The whole process of yoga is to shatter your identities.Be a seeker please do not believe anything until you experience it yourselfIn Advait Vedanta Shiva is described as the infinitely vast dark empty space / void / nothingness which is holding the entire universe.Some call that God some say that is Allah some say Krishna we call that Shiva and scientists are studying it as unknown Dark energy and Dark matter.If you want to give him a new name (example: XYZ) give him any name he won't mind!If you don't believe in him even then he won't mind. It's like one of your tiny body cells say : I don't believe that you exist I have a separate identity and I am not a part of you…would you mind it? Shiva is also described as niraakar roopam (without any shape or size) vast nothingness or emptiness (Shoonyata). Only ‘Shoonyata’ (which was there before creation started & which will remain after destruction of universe) qualifies for ‘niraakar’ (formless) because creation would always have a particular size and shape. This has been proven that the whole universe is in vibrational form which was described in our ancient texts as “Nada Bramha” ( Universe is just sound or vibration) Scientists say that at sub-atomic level there is no mass but only energy (which we call as Shakti) and subatomic particles constantly disappear in to nothingness (destruction) and re-appear out of nothing (creation). As per experiences of spiritual masters all the things in this universe are different manifestations of same energy (Shakti).Before creation of universe there was only vast nothingness (shoonya shiva or emptiness) then energy (shakti) appeared out of nothingness and whole universe was created as a manifestation of energy (with help of nothingness) and this process is happening every moment.These two fundamental forces are known as yin & yang shiv & shakti etc.‘Nothing’ & ‘something’ combined to make ‘everything’…Have you noticed ? All computer programs are also made of only 2 fundamental binary digits '0′ (nothing) and ‘1’ (something) isn't it? If you observe everything around with a keen interest you will be able to see how these 2 fundamental forces are working every moment for the process of 'creation' and 'destruction'.If you will do research about dark matter dark energy higgs boson and god particle you will realise that the whole universe is a manifestation of energyNow coming back to Bholenath Baba or bhagwan Shankar (or many other names) he was described as “Yaksha swaroop” which means he was not in human form because he was a extra terrestrial being. Bholenath Shankar ji is considered a form of Shiva because he reached a “meditative state” wherein spiritually there was no difference left between him and Shiva.He was the first Guru who showed the path of Yog (the ultimate union) with the Shiv inside us. Many people may call Bholenath's story as a mythology and may dis-believe it and you have every right to say that because no one knows what exactly happened. However Shiva is not a story figure he is the one and only ‘formless’ cosmic consciousness which is present everywhere. There is a misconception that Hindus believe in 33 crore Gods and Goddesses. There are many deities or demigods considered as different manifestations of same God. (For example : Indra Surya etc. cannot be compared with ultimate God because they are ‘devtas’ not ‘Paramaatma’) Even Bramha Vishnu & Mahesh are described as 3 different aspects (creation operation & destruction) of the same 'one' God. Some ignorant people get into debates like who is greater Krishna or Shankar? Such people do not even know the essence of Hinduism or Sanatan dharma. When someone says Krishna is inside us or Krishna is everywhere is he talking about the physical body which participated in Mahabharata war and in the end died because of an arrow of a hunter? Krishna or Rama were names given to respective physical bodies and when we say Krishna is everywhere of course no one is talking about that physical body. We are talking about the universal conciousness or cosmic soul which is common for Krishna Rama Shankar Jesus Buddha etc. hence that conciousness is literally everywhere. (Within us also). The only difference is you have not realised it yet. We all are different forms of same God.Hindus believe in only 'one' God but call him by different names.Would you like to experience Shiv? Just look around because he is everywhere even better would be to try looking ‘inside.’Ask yourself who is reading this answer through your eyes?Understanding all this intellectually is of no use experience the Shiv within you directly make it the goal of your life and make sure you do not stop until you are blessed with Self realization. Once you are self realized no outside situation can bother you because you will be in ultimate bliss. Awake!

Pāṣaṇḍīs do not believe in one God the Supreme Personality Lord Viṣṇu; they think that all the demigods have the same potency as He. The definition of a pāṣaṇḍī is given in the tantra-śāstra: yas tu nārāyaṇaṁ devaṁ brahma-rudrādi-daivataiḥsamatvenaiva vīkṣeta sa pāṣaṇḍī bhaved dhruvam(CC Madhya 18.116) “A pāṣaṇḍī is one who considers the great demigods such as Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead Nārāyaṇa.” (Hari-bhakti-vilāsa 1.17) The Supreme Personality of Godhead is asamordhva; in other words no one can be equal to or greater than Him. But pāṣaṇḍīs do not believe this. They worship any kind of demigod thinking it all right to accept whomever they please as the Supreme Lord. The pāṣaṇḍīs were against the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu and now we see practically that they also do not like our humble attempts to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world. On the contrary these pāṣaṇḍīs say that we are spoiling the Hindu religion because people all over the world are accepting Lord Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to the version of Bhagavad-gītā As It Is. The pāṣaṇḍīs condemn this movement and sometimes they accuse Vaiṣṇavas from foreign countries of being not bona fide. Even so-called Vaiṣṇavas—pseudo followers of the Vaiṣṇava cult—do not agree with our activities in making Vaiṣṇavas in the Western countries. Such pāṣaṇḍīs existed even during the time of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and they continue to exist. Despite all the activities of these pāṣaṇḍīs however the prediction of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu will triumph: pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma/ sarvatra pracāra haibe mora nāma. “In every town and village the chanting of My name will be heard.” No one can check the spread of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement because upon this movement is the benediction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. ~ Purport to Chaitanya Charitamrita Adi 17.206So it's clear how Vaishnava Dharma is rapidly progressing inundating the entire planet with eternal love for Radha Madhava and giving “ Hibbie Gibbies “ to Mayavadis and other Atheistic sects. Since I came this far let's stretch it even a bit more. The eternal Bhagavata Dharma is not done yet it ain't gonna stop till the entire planet gets lost in Kṛṣṇa prema. Going further…Lord Nityananda declared :-PUNAH PRABHU-ICCHA HA'YE BALAVANHA'BE MAYAPÜRE EI RUPA VASA-STHANA EI SABA GHĀTA GANGA-TIRE PUNAH HA'BE PRABHURA MANDIRA KARIBENA BHAKTA SABE ADBHUTA MANDIRA EKA HAIBE PRAKASA GAURANGERA NITYASEVA HAIBE VIKASA When the will of the Lord becomes strong  again Mayapur will be a residence . All the bathing ghats will appear  and the devotees will build the Lord's temple . one astonishing temple will manifest and the eternal service to Gauranga will blossom . ~ NDM Chapter 5Srila Jiva Goswami declared :-According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī the words kvacit kvacit in this verse indicate that in Kali-yuga Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya will appear in Gauḍa-deśa in the district of Nadia. And from this pivotal point He will gradually expand the flood of love of Godhead to cover the entire earth. Many exalted devotees such as Śrī Advaitācārya also take birth in Gauḍa-deśa. Purport to Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 11.5.38Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur has declared :-On such a day they will say “Our dear Brothers we have taken shelter of the ocean of Lord Caitanya’s Love; kindly embrace us” that day will witness the holy transcendental ecstasy of the Vaisnava dharma to be the only dharma and all sects and religions will flow like rivers into the ocean of Vaisnava dharma. Oh when will that day come?” In another place Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura repeats the same prediction a little differently: “Oh when will that day come when pure and transcendental Vaisnava prema will be the only religion of all souls and all tiny sectarian religions will meet in the unlimited and universal religion of Vaisnavism as rivers merge into the great ocean? O when will that day come? (Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura – Sajjana Tosani 1885)गुरु गौरङ्ग जयतु। जयतु वैष्णवधर्मः। इदं सर्वं कृष्णार्पणम्।“May victory be unto Guru and Gauranga.

First the assumption in the question is actually correct. The temple is definitely the weakest point in the human skull. This area (the Pterion) is a meeting point of several skull bones and it is the thinnest part of the skull. This ‘relative’ weakness leads to volunerability to the middle meningeal artery which runs below it and can be damaged or ruptured with a blow to the temple leading to ‘brain bleed’ with the obvious catastrophic consequences. However while the human skull does have some relative weaknesses we have evolved a tough skull that is well built and suitable for the kind of natural activities we have evolved with over the last 2 million years activities required for survival in the bush like hunting gathering running eating climbing making babies and complex tools and using them successfully and becoming an Apex species. Indeed some compromises had to happen to allow that to happen. A larger brain required a bigger cavity with more efficient blood supply to feed it and this required some necessary design changes which has some weaknesses but not enough to compromise our evolution as a whole. So yes the temple is the weakest part of the skull but is far from being weak as it can support a jaw with a bite force of 1100 to 1300 Newtons which is not as strong a bite of a gorilla or a chimp but is stronger than that of orangutans and Gibbons. In fact our bite force is also stronger than the Australopithecus an earlier human we evolved from. This proves evolution has improved our skull structures and has sculpted a very efficient and appropriate overall design albeit with some compromises to suit our overall survival capabilities. After all at 7.5 billion people and growing many of which can travel in fast cars motorcycles and some lucky ones in rockets to the moon and back are good evidence of that evolutionary success. We may need some added protection for some modern activities that we have not evolved to tackle over the millennia but that’s a small price to pay for that success.

Perhaps the answer is hidden in the last Answer of a very famous and arguably respectful entity : NATHURAM GODSE the murderer of Gandhi I’ll just try to translate his last words in the court at the time of trial of Gandhi’s Murder case. “I had conflicts with leaders and I still carry them. This is comprehensible from my letter named Savarkar dated 28 Feb 1935. I have the same ideology even today. I did not have any hostility with Gandhi Ji. People say that his heart was pure in Pakistan’s plan. I want to convey to people that I do not have anything other than patriotism. I had to use the arms because at the time of partition the cruel and frightful things that took place were solely led by Gandhi Ji. I knew that after the murder people will change their views about me I’ll loose all the respect I have in the society.I knew that I’ll be criticized brutally by the newspapers but I didn’t know that Newspapers would degenerate to such a level that they’ll start killing the truth. Newspapers never wrote impartially. If they cared about the Nation and paid less attention to the personal wishes of certain people then the national leaders would have never accepted Pakistan. Newspapers clearly followed the ideology of hiding the brutal and unworthy mistakes of leaders. This made our country’s division easy. I feared such corrupt newspapers but I made sure that I don’t bend in front of them.Some say that if Pakistan wasn’t formed we couldn't have got independence I don’t consider this right. This is a made up excuse by the leaders in an attempt to hide their sins. Gandhivadi(followers of Gandhi) say that they got Swaraj by their own will. If they got Swaraj by their own will how did the British were even able to state conditions of Division? Why didn’t they use their will to oppose them?According to me Mahatma and his followers always had one policy that is showing opposition toward the demands of British then try and compensate and then totally agree on their terms. This is how Pakistan’s formation was accepted.On 15 August 1947 Pakistan was accepted Trick fully. No thought was given to the Hindus of Punjab Bengal and other states across the border. Country was broken into pieces and a Nation was formed just on the basis of religion. Muslims got the fruit of their anti national seeds in the form of Pakistan. Gandhivadis called those people anti-nationals and communal who were against Pakistan and themselves accepted Pakistan and agreed to all the conditions of Jinnah.This destroyed my mental peace. After the creation of Pakistan if congress government did something for the protection of Hindus in Pakistan then my Anger would have decreased. I couldn't see the betrayal of my own people. Crores of Hindus were left on the mercy of Muslims and promoted the idea that Hindus should not come to India and should remain in Pakistan. This way Hindus were trapped in the clutter of Muslims and became prey to the calamities there. Thousands of Hindus were killed everyday 15 Lakh sikhs were brutally murdered on the gunpoint. Hindu Women were taken out for processions nude. They were sold just as Animals. Lakhs of Hindus had to save their Religion and run. If Indian Government pressurized Pakistan Government or warned them of a similar treatment to Muslims in India then I believe this situation would not have come. But they did nothing to save the Hindu community there.Indian government ran on the ideals of Gandhi Ji and If a newspaper wrote something about the conditions of Hindus there they were considered as the creators of tensions among the two groups. There things were started to considered as Criminal. Press Emergency Act was established and one after the other truth was uprooted. Even I got certain notice and ₹60000 were demanded. Around 900 such instances took place. When the press association visited Morarji Desai he didn’t cater to a single demand.By this I was clear that non-violence was not the answer to the Gandhivadi Congress Government. Around this time Gandhi gave no statement against Pakistan. Pakistan left no stone upturned to reduce or completely end the Hindu culture.The most important thing is that in reference to the Hindu-Muslim conflict Gandhi never catered to the very demands and viewpoint of general Public. It is clear that until Pakistan remains based on religion and is communal India can never be at peace. ”The speech continues to a lot more and covers a lot of other instances. Certainly the answer would become to long to be readable if I translate every word. Therefore I’ll brief certain more points of his speech.Gandhi sat on Anshan(Hunger Strike) with demands such as getting the Mosques in Delhi free from Hindus. Hindus obviously were residing there out of Helplessness.Gandhi cleverly kept no condition for Pakistan because he knew that Jinnah would have no affect and he certainly would die out of Hunger and the world would see how such a bold man is not able to get a country he gave Independence to agree to a single condition.Gandhi’s bones were flown in many rivers in many parts of the world without a single bone being flown in any river in Pakistan.Godse did not run or did not even try to run because he wanted the world to know why he killed Gandhi.Godse only fired 2 bullets But his body had 4 bullets fired in it.He said I could have poisoned Gandhi or killed him in a way that it looks like a natural death but I chose to kill him with bullets so I can tell the world the truth that would never come out otherwise.Essentially I am not a believer of either of the ideology. I make no declaration to the truthfulness of any of the facts. This simply is the answer to why Gandhi is hated even today by many people in India and outside. I’d also thank Quora for bringing up such a great platform to share different views and opinions. That’s why one certainly loves Quora.

He was a great warrior. All these virutes were nullified by joining Adharm joining Duryodhan. A full pot of A2 milk gets spooled by a small stone of salt. To keep friendship and to keep his word he behaved very badly and unethically with Pandavas. So he was not respected by public. But he was always admired and depended on by Kauravas. Karna always supported adharmic deeds and vulgarly talked about Draupadi who was Maharani and wife of Pandavas.,Avinash Kulkarni,https://www.quora.com/profile/Avinash-Kulkarni-53

Midway through dinner as the other person is talking your mind abruptly says to you: “I never want to hangout with this person again.” It isn’t a malicious thought. It is just a gut feeling.

I am proof of that :-) The classical restriction on Sudras was not the performing of any rituals even Vedic rituals it was the reciting of Vedic texts. In order to recite Vedic texts one had to study classical Sanskrit and master the intricacies of Vedic chanting with swaras. Incorrect pronunciation it was believed would lead to negative and sometime contrary results. Seeing that the Sudras were all working people who had no Vedic education they were banned from reciting the texts necessary for Vedic fire sacrifices. Originally there was no class of domestic priests (purohitas) because every one could do their own rituals and even their own sacraments including marriages. Over time even the twice-born stopped studying the Vedas and thus made themselves ineligible for reciting sūktas - and this brought about the rise of the purohita class which made a living by performing rituals for others. Most of the Sudras had their own priests or family elders that would perform their rituals according to caste customs. With the rise of the social mobility of the Sudras and the decline of Vedic learning among the twice-born castes the purohitas began catering to the ritual and sacramental needs of the wealthier classes i.e. Sudras who had adopted Brahminical practices. So nowadays most Brahmin purohits perform rituals for Sudras and especially in north India include them and allow them to perform the ritual actions and even to recite mantras. In South India some purohits still refrain from serving Sudra clients or if they do they perform all the rituals on their behalf without them participating. Most of my 400 odd client families are Sudras with only a smattering of Brahmin families. The Brahmins only come to me when they want cremations done as the majority of Brahmin purohits refuse to perform ceremonies related to death for any one. I have even taught and instructed Brahmin purohits and many of them secretly use me as a ritual consultant! I have also had on rare occasions Brahmin priests refusing to work with me on marriages and other sacraments because I am a Sudra. The Gurukal priests generally will never invite me to any of their domestic sacraments but will work with me on major temple consecration ceremonies (kumbha abhishekam.),Rami Sivan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Rami-Sivan

If Shiva is a destroyer God why do Hindus worship him? To answer this question first we should understand Who Shiva actually is. Before that please understand that the Supreme Gods that we talk of are the different concepts of this universe and those who are believed to be their human forms are the teachers who taught us those concepts. Lord Siva has two forms: Siva and Sankara; Siva being the divine concept and Sankara being the first teacher of the Shaiva concept. ‘Shaiva’ concept is all about ‘Mahakaal’ which means ‘The Great Time’. He is the personification of time. As time brings end to everything in this world this concept is called as the Lord of Death. ‘Time’ (Lord Siva) is the one who laid platform for everything to exist in this universe. He is the ultimate truth in life - death; which is delivered by time. He is the dark empty space (nothingness or darkness) that covers the major portion of the universe. In other words Shiva is the concept of ‘Space-Time’. So he is known as ‘Adi’ and ‘Anandh’; which means someone who exists from the very beginning and one with no end. He is the time and space which existed before the universe came in to existence and which will exist even after the universe ceases to exist. Sankara was called as the ‘Adi Sidhar’ which means the first teacher. He was a wanderer and spread the concept of Space-Time among the humans. He rested in burial grounds and rubbed ashes all over his body. He was a great dancer and educated the humans the art of dancing; which gave him the name ‘Nataraj’ – ‘The King of Dance’. He also taught the first form of Martial Arts which was known as ‘Kalari-Payatu’ to the Warrior Saint Parasurama who then taught it to the humans. Now you see the Hindus do not worship destruction but embraces the fact that death is the only truth in life which is sure to come. They believe in getting rid of their desires before the day they meet their ‘Kaal’ (Time) so as to die in Peace. They have learned the ultimate truth in life (Mukthi and Moksha) and thus do not take anything for granted. I would suggest you to read a book ‘A Quest For A Lifetime’ for better understanding of these concepts. Thank You.,Sunil Raveendran,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sunil-Raveendran-4

Many students and parents will have a problem with making it compulsory for them to stay in hostels with no such restrictions. From the administration's perspective they will question the benefit of this rule. There are no restrictions in interacting with the opposite sex outside the hostel (it's a different issue altogether that the 12:30 rule for girls restricts that though) so they would not see any reason to allow entry inside hostels.,Saksham Bhatla,https://www.quora.com/profile/Saksham-Bhatla

I would like to provide a small detailing before i start stating the mysteries. This temple was built by a chola king called raja raja chola. It is believed that it was built for years and years to bring it to what it is now.The approximate estimate is said to be 1000 years old. A very recent celebration in a grandeur manner happened for it’s 1000th year too.This is the overall dusk appearance of the temple.And in broad daylight it may look just like above. Now coming to the part of mysteries the following are the widely believed existing mysteries (1)Underground passages all over the temple It is believed that the temple houses more than 100 underground passages. Few even connect to the raja raja chola palace. These were indeed believed to be used by important government associates and the King by himself. It is said that the king used one of these in occasions to provide special abishekam(a kind of holy water shower) to the Lord shiva.The above tunnel is one such underground passage. It is belived that the tunnels were made wide enough to let even a whole horse ride inside it. (2)Huge capstone of the templeThe biggest mystery of all in it is this. The capstone has a weight of 80 tons. Considering the period when it was built it is probably impossible to lift such a huge stone and place it high in a height of 216 feet. The only medium of strong carriers were elephants. It seems completely mysterious to think how they made it happen just with elephants. With the same capstone there comes the engineering marvel too. It was built in such a manner that the shadow of the head capstone never hits the ground. People renowned in the field of architecture still wonder this architectural marvel.(3)Paintings of the brahadeshwara temple The temple houses a lot of murals all the way inside it. Kind of the following   Believe it or not all these were made centuries ago using natural ingredients like flower petal extracts turmeric powder neem extracts and other natural colouring agents. They still look visible and bright enough to get admired! (4)Usage of granite stones for the temple constructionThe entire temple was built using granite stones. The mystery doesnt lie in this but in close neighbourhood as far as archaeological evidences suggest there were no traces of granite sources. It is said all these were brought miles afar just using the only way of carriers-The elephants!!! Bringing every bit of raw material from a far place continuously till the end is a big thing in those days!!! (5)Cutting and carving of granite stonesIt is just like the above the granite stones are cut in these modern days. Even this looks hard and robust to make it get broken. A fact says it takes minimum of one hour and gallons and gallons of water to break these stones(even these days). Imagine the period when this temple was built it would have needed extreme efforts to get them broken!!!!How did the Cholas make it happen in their life time?!?! A mystery..! (6)Secret passages inside the temple You may wonder how does this differ from the underground passages…yes these served for totally different purpose than those. These so called secret passages were used by the Royals and their subordinates in their extreme emergencies like ambush enemy attack when the only way left for them to protect the nation is to survive first and face the rest later. These passages were highly confidential that they were discovered only generations later for the commoners!!!Considering every mystery and every astonishing fact residing behind this temple it can be said it is a WONDER in itself! This point may seem a bit irrelevant to this question but still i wish i can use this answering opportunity to convey this.. It is our onus to preserve highly cultural and architecturally marvelous structures like these.. Let us make a visit to it if we can and let us spread about structures like these as much as we can! We marvel a lot of buildings and structures of modern times built in abroad but we hardly do know that we ourselves were great architects and builders! Structures like tanjore temple do stand as a living epitome for my claim so!!!!!!,Gayathri Swaminathan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Gayathri-Swaminathan-11
RelatedWhy do Hindu temples must be freed from the government of India's control?,https://historyofindiasss.quora.com/Why-do-Hindu-temples-must-be-freed-from-the-government-of-Indias-control,,Why not these Hindu temples be freed from the clutches of the government atleast now?. Sadhguru wants all the Hindu temples in TN to be freed from the TN government's control and wants the Hindus to manage these temples further. These temples were built by the Kings in the past such as Chola Chera and Pandiya respectively and they built these temples out of their devotion towards the Gods and Goddesses respectively from the money collected from the Hindus. Hence these temples belong to the people who are Hindus and not anybody else like TN government. Also since India is secular the government should stop interfering with the religious matters of Hindus too. The TN government is formed by the dravidian parties like DMK DK ADMK and either DMK or ADMK has been ruling TN for many decades and no choice was there for the people to elect other than these two dravidian parties. It is unfortunate that these dravidian parties possess Periyar idealogies and only on that basis the TN state has been ruled. It is known to everybody in TN that Periyar idealogies are entirely against the religion Hinduism and it's beliefs. So this is one of the reasons why the TN government refuses to take steps in spending money on these Hindu temples where repairing works are still needed and these temples are in a ruining state too. The condition of these temples gradually gets weaker as time progresses. The other reason is money yielded by these temples through the devotees offerings too. The government is still interested only on the money derived from these temples and refuses to leave it's control on them due to money. Sadhguru has observed that these temples aren't being maintained by the government as required. Many idols of the dieties in various temples have gone stolen and in those places fake ones were replaced. The land that belongs to these temples are grabbed by the government and is used for it's selfish purposes and the money donated by the devotees are in the pockets of the politicians. Where are those money allocated for the repairing works of these temples?. This needs an investigation too. HR and CE officials are responsible for the present state of these temples too and they must be questioned too. Hence if this state proceeds with these temples we can't help them from getting destroyed. Also the government pays no attention to these temples as the government possess Periyar idealogies that targets Hinduism and it's beliefs too. Hence how can anyone expect that TN government will do things for the welfare of these temples anymore?. It is shameful for them to have it's control on these temples only for it's income. This should change first.,HISTORY OF INDIA,https://historyofindiasss.quora.com/

It looks to me that the later was more true. Worshiping Lord Raghuvir (Ram) and Sitala Devi (A form of Durga) as family deities was in vogue in Sri Ramakrishna's family. But there doesn't seem to be any specific instance of Sri Ramakrishna's 'attachment' to Sitala Devi for worship in his early years. Sri Ramakrishna's first ""encounter"" with Maa Kali seems have happened when he took a pilgrimage as a boy along with local women to Anoor Visalakshi Temple. As he was walking with the women singing bhajans on Divine mother he suddenly went into a trance - attaining bhava Samadhi and getting immersed in overwhelming emotions on Devi. Later in his late teens he went to Kolkata to assist his elder brother Ramkumar who was earning the very livelihood through practicing purohitam (priesthood) for the family stricken with poverty at Kamarpukur. Ramkumar got appointed to to Dakshineswar Kali temple as the priest and Sri Ramakrishna too shifted to the temple premises only very reluctantly. Interestingly the orthodox Brahmin mindset he had in those days made him decline to eat Kali's Prasad! I believe it was gradually afterword that Dakshineswar Bhavatarini Kali started Her divine play of 'possessing' the reluctant Village Brahmin teenager and making him her own and finally making his Self her own divine abode! The rest is history. Kali worship Tantra and Sri Ramakrishna Regarding significance of Kali Worship Shaktas will give lots of reasons based on Puranas and Tantra Shastras about the superiority of Kali worship over other sects. In my opinion it was another very strong sect (like Gaudiya Vaishnavism in Bengal) existing in those periods thanks to the widespread practice of Tantra amid Bengalis. It may be pointed out that Sri Ramakrishna practiced Tantra under the methodical and strict guidance of Bhairavi Brahmani and attained the pinnacle of divine experience as per Tantra Shastras. But during his days Tantra Shastra had attained quite a bad reputation because it was conveniently misunderstood and practiced by many to enjoy drinking and sex. Leaving behind the core idea of transcending those meaner pulls to attain divinity (Unity of Shiva and Shakti) through enjoying and overcoming Tantra in practice had considerably degenerated those days. By the strength of his divine experience Sri Ramakrishna strongly warned against those practices of Tantra; he pointed out that the chances of falling were rather more than succeeding by the secret practicing of indulgence in the Pancha Makaras -- madya (wine) māṃsa (meat) matsya (fish) mudrā (parched grain) and maithuna (sexual intercourse) of the Tantra.Sri Ramakrishna prescribed Bhakti as the bes...",C.V.Rajan,https://www.quora.com/profile/C-V-Rajan-1

Datta enters energetic form predominated by Sattvam called as Vishnu. Datta enters energetic form predominated by Tamas called as Shiva. If you utter the word ‘unimaginable God’ it gives lot of strain to mind because the meaning of the word is that you can never imagine Him (avyaktaahi… Gita). Hence the Gita advises all the souls to take the unimaginable God as Datta or Hiranyagarbha or Narayana or Sadashiva. In the above verses the word ‘I’ represents the ultimate unimaginable God who is not at all different in any way from Datta. Here other deities mean Vishnu and Shiva. Whether you worship Brahma or Vishnu or Shiva it is the direct worship of Datta only. Even though the hidden Datta is not worshipped directly (avidhipurvakam) while worshipping Brahma or Vishnu or Shiva it is also direct worship of Datta only (tepimaameva…yajanti). Even while worshipping human incarnations like Rama Krishna Saibaba etc. it is direct worship of Datta only since Datta entered and merged with the medium. But when you worship other angels like Indra thinking that Indra is Datta it is not direct worship of Datta. It is only worship of representative model of Datta. Similarly you can worship any human being as Datta. In all such worships Datta is indirectly worshipped and such worship will improve your theoretical devotion on God and hence is not useless. If you worship Shakti like Vani Lakshmi Parvati Radha etc it is the worship of a devoted soul that reached the climax of devotion. In incarnation God becomes the soul due to homogenous merge. The worship of such devotees is no doubt indirect worship of Datta only. But God is a servant of such exceptional devotees. The worship of such devotees is greater than the worship of even the human incarnation since mastering is greater than equality. The worship of such devotee has merit that it is more powerful than the worship of human incarnation. The defect in this worship is that it is not the direct worship of God. Similarly in the worship of incarnation the merit is that it is direct worship of God and the defect is that God will bless you in the way which is best for your spiritual progress and not in the way as you desire. When you worship an exceptional devotee who is the master of God your wish is blindly fulfilled by God. The exceptional devotee is near to you because it is also a soul with a body. The soul of the exceptional devotee is paraprakruti and the body of the same devotee is aparaprakruti. You are also a mixture of these two types of prakruti. Hence the exceptional devotee is homogenous with you. Your wish is easily agreed by the exceptional devotee and gets blindly fulfilled by the God acting as servant. Hence the devotees worshipping Shakti (prakruti) get all the boons according to their will and sometimes fall. The devotee of incarnation will not have such fall because God will grant only that which is really the best in the eternal life of the soul.

When you water the roots there is no need to water the leaves. Similarly Sri Krishna is the root and if you worship him there is no need to worship other devatas.That is why he said:Bhagwat Gita 9:23:Whatever a man may sacrifice to other gods O son of Kunti is really meant for Me alone but it is offered without true understanding. BG 9:27: O son of Kunti all that you do all that you eat all that you offer and give away as well as all austerities that you may perform should be done as an offering unto Me.Those who worship the devatas will take birth among the devatas; those who worship the ancestors go to the ancestors; those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings; and those who worship Me will live with Me. BG 9:34:Engage your mind always in thinking of Me offer obeisances and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me surely you will come to Me.BG 18:57 :In all activities just depend upon Me and work always under My protection. In such devotional service be fully conscious of Me. BG 18:65 :Always think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your homage unto Me. Thus you will come to Me without fail. I promise you this because you are My very dear friend.BG 18:66 :Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear. Bg 9.25:Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the dvatas; those who worship the ancestors go to the ancestors; those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings; and those who worship Me will live with Me.Bg 9.24 — I am the only enjoyer and master of all sacriﬁces. Therefore those who do not recognize My true transcendental nature fall down. Men of small intelligence worship the devatas and their fruits are limited and temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the devatas but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.JAI SRI MUKUNDA🙏,Shree Keshava,https://www.quora.com/profile/Shree-Keshava

This way she is never separate from Vishnu even when he assumes different avataaras (V.P 1.9.144) When Hari assumes the form of devata Lakshmi becomes his devi when Hari becomes man (human form) she becomes his woman. In this way she too assumes forms according to the forms of bhagavan Vishnu. (V.P 1.9.145)Thus we can understand the eternal relationship between the divine couple Sri Rukmini Krishna. She is personification of his divine attributes. She is his ichha shakti “willing potency”. She is the canvas through which he projects his kalyana gunas. He express his desires through her. For Sristi Sthiti Laya Anugraha and Nigraha they play the game in which she desires and he fulfills. He especially projects some special kalyana gunas like compassion forgiveness and extreme love towards the devotees only through her. Gopala Tapani upanisada says Rukmini is the eternal consort of Krishna who is never separable from him and she is the potency with which he creates operates and destroys the entire creations.,Bhawesh Bhattarai,https://www.quora.com/profile/Bhawesh-Bhattarai

This is one of the question that vexes society. In one sense I do not like non-Hindus to visit temples because their motive is not worship they come to gawk at what is exotic to them and take a flurry of pictures.  I was recently in Arunachala and there a group of women were lighting multiple lamps in a single plate and were doing aradhana at a shrine. Then comes along a white lady with her camera and start taking pictures the ladies got distracted and started posing for the camera to the end that the white women was directing them on how to stand to get the best light etc. And in the meantime bhava was lost. Who is to blame here? But then there is no guarantee that every Hindu who visits a temple has similar devotion. Nor is that all non-Hindus come to gawk as tourists. So it is a call the temples have to make there is no perfect solution to such.  In my opinion given my experience of Abrahamic religions where they think to pray to ""idols"" is bizarre and exotic. I rather fall on the other side of the line that they should not be allowed to visit the Shrines. A Hindu can visit a Church or a Mosque for a simple reason that a Hindu does not consider such a worship as pagan heathen or mushrik. The Hindu does not stand in judgement. But Abrahamics do stand in judgement upon other religions. I do not want to invite someone to my home knowing that their motives are thus. And I don't want my heritage to be gawked at or our practices - as though we are performing monkeys in a circus act. Sure there will be exceptions to this but it is near impossible to verify. So for now I think it is better policy to keep them away.  Be it USCIRF or people like Jeffery Kripal trusting them and giving them access has turned out to be a bad choice for us. For they end up demeaning what we value.  We should stop being suckers for the ""white person's opinion"" we are proud that they appreciate our art heritage etc. But every time this has lead to that particular art or custom being stripped of its dharmic moorings and marketed as a ""secularized"" exotic product and slowly appropriated. I know it is not intuitive for us to be suspicious. But it is better we learn from History.",Raghu Bhaskaran,https://www.quora.com/profile/Raghu-Bhaskaran

RelatedIs the Bhagawad Gita about jnana or bhakti? Why?,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Bhagawad-Gita-about-jnana-or-bhakti-Why,,The quick answer is both but bhakti is more important. Krishna spoke the Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna. They are His own words which He confirms by stating that He previously gave the knowledge to Vivasvan and He is now repeating it to Arjuna because it has become lost. He doesn’t say that He learned this science from someone else or that He is speaking on behalf of someone else. Within the material world everyone has to learn or somehow acquire the knowledge they have only the Supreme Lord is exempted from this. This indicates that Krishna is that person. He declares Himself to be the highest truth the source and maintenance of whatever exists including the impersonal Brahman. He declares that all living entities are eternally individual fragmental parts of Him and to back up His words He manifests His universal form. So we can take it that Krishna says what He means that His words are authoritative and we should accept them as He spoke them. At the beginning of chapter 5 Arjuna asks Krishna which is better. Detachment or working with devotion (bhakti) Krishna’s answer is clear.The Personality of Godhead replied: The renunciation of work and work in devotion are both good for liberation. But of the two work in devotional service is better than renunciation of work. Bg 5.2Later Krishna explains that the result of actual knowledge is surrender to Krishna because He is the cause of all causes.After many births and deaths he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare. 7.19Krishna encourages the cultivation of knowledge silent meditation and performing prescribed activities. These are explained as different yoga processes. Jnana yoga dhyana yoga karma yoga and so on but He gives His opinion on which of these is the highest.And of all yogis the one with great faith who always abides in Me thinks of Me within himself and renders transcendental loving service to Me -- he is the most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all. That is My opinion. Bg 6.47He says that it is He who is to be known by all the Vedas. That means He is the object of all jnana and all karma.By all the Vedas I am to be known. Indeed I am the compiler of Vedanta and I am the knower of the Vedas. Bg 15.15Krishna speaks elaborately about cultivating knowledge and detachment and performing bhakti and in Chapter nine He says that whoever you may be and whatever birth you may have taken it doesn’t matter simply…Engage your mind always in thinking of Me become My devotee offer obeisances to Me and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me surely you will come to Me. Bg 9.34Here bhakti once again is recommended for achieving Krishna. Then Krishna explains His opulences and exhibits His universal form and then Arjuna asks which is better to worship the Lord in His personal form or to worship His impersonal aspect. Krishna replies that it’s better to worship Him in His personal form. Not just better but the best.Those who fix their minds on My personal form and are always engaged in worshiping Me with great and transcendental faith are considered by Me to be most perfect. Bg 12.2After discussing the three modes of nature and all the different variations that arise in the material world Krishna gives His concluding wordsAlways think of Me become My devotee worship Me and offer your homage unto Me. Thus you will come to Me without fail. I promise you this because you are My very dear friend. Bg 18.65It is a repeat of His previous instruction in chapter 9 that should tell us that it’s important. As long as we are here in the material world we will be forced by nature to act. We may cultivate knowledge but then what will we do with that knowledge? We may know that we are atma that we are spiritual but what will we do? Any material activity will simply keep us entangled by the reaction. No one can remain inactive even for a moment. We have senses and our senses demand gratification as long as we remain absorbed in senses-gratification our suffering will be prolonged. Performing activities for the pleasure of Krishna instead of ourselves or our extended selves frees us from this dilemma and unites us with Krishna. This is the essence of bhakti and it is what Krishna recommends as the highest the easiest the most practical and the conclusion of all jnana.,Murari Das,https://www.quora.com/profile/Murari-Das-1

Btech students were planing to buy autorikshaw. Some were planning for open gala pan shop. No talks about sense everybody is depressed and seeking escape by alchoholoppsite sexssome were caught with weed too just outside the campus Study Faculty are good but you wont get any environment to study as 98 % people dont want to study.you will be confuse that you should prepare home as classes dont have environment or you waste your time as attendace criteria is cumplosary. Lot of useless event so you may not be able to concentrate. Practically all the labs are damaged and are under maintenance till I have studied.i have passed in 2019. Want a proof just go to mechanical or civil labs. They have much to show but very less to perform. Hostel life Its ohk actually compared to other hostel but Campus security is too narrow minded and they act like police officials. If just a girl or boy is standing they will treat them like craps. Useless shitty rules. You dont have any authority and chance to question decision. The charges a lot and can expelled you from hostel at any time without returning your fees. They will fine you uselessly. Moreover you cannot move all the parts of garden as show in their ad. Placements This is my fav. You are some sales guy or want to do clerical job you go there. But want some serious placements never approach here . Firstly you dont get job but if you are lucky and talentedyhe They provide you shitty jobs with placements of 13k per month or lower. If you are very lucky and talented and had done some good deeds people pray for you  god grace is upon you then you may get a 23k jobs in core which is 1 in 10000 chance. Fee have been placed in govt. Org but they have Preparations were after they have passed the college. If you want Btech good placements except I.t (stay very very away). Other facilities They give you gym which is mostly overcrowded and only 1 hour from which 25 mins go in waiting. Swimming pool is there. Canteen is good Safety College is absolutely safe there is nothing to fear for girls boys or ragging. Its totally safe all the things people talk some of them are rumours. Few are real too In my opinion most of the people are depressed and have lost faith in studies due to environment. College like this have low merit. And once you have passed out you will find yourself to be victim of education trap. If you want a good job dont go on advertisement. Seek for good companies and ask them how they got placed from which college. If you are planning for future plan it in a well way. Dont just ask unclemamapapa friend who will give u job . They all will run away ask someone who have literally achieved something in that field Above written statement my own experience other may vary but if you want just go to beautiful campus and atleast meet 20 students of college and ask opinion(atleast 20).,Akshay Patel,https://www.quora.com/profile/Akshay-Patel-273

The computer contains a physical simulation of a complex system. Initial conditions of that simulation correspond to a singularity so not only do these initial conditions represent the beginning of the simulation it is mathematically impossible to extend the simulation to a prior moment. In my simulation time really begins at that moment; there is no “before”. Yet here I am existing independently of that simulation. My time (measured by my clock) is not the same as the simulation time (measured by a variable in the simulation program code.) I existed “before” the simulation started even though within the simulation there is no “before”. If my simulation is sufficiently complex maybe even intelligent beings emerge in this simulated reality. Beings who start to wonder about the nature of their own existence. Beings who discover the rules (programmed by me) that govern their simulated universe. Thus they will discover that time (the only time they know) has a definite beginning and that there is no “before”. And perhaps some of these beings become philosophers wondering about the (im)possibility of an eternal god given that they live in a universe that had a finite beginning. Short story: If you believe in a god you need not believe that this god is actually part of this universe in which we live. Perhaps your god exists outside of it not subject to the rules that govern this universe.,Viktor T. Toth,https://www.quora.com/profile/Viktor-T-Toth-1

What is it You are meditating about all the time?” The Lord smiled and answered “I meditate on my dearest Lord Narayana. There is not one moment when I'm not thinking about my Lord. He lives in my heart and I worship Him every instance of time.” Narada then went straight to Vaikuntha where He saw Lord Vishnu lying in eternal tranquility on the bed of Adishesha serpernt. The Lord was in yoganidra state seeming to worship someone. Narada mesmerized by that sight asked “Oh Lord whenever I come to see You You are always in a blissful meditative state of yoganidra. What is it that You are thinking about all the time?” A pleasant smile got spread across Lord's face and He said “Oh great sage Narada it is my dearest Lord Shiva Who I always think about Who I always meditate upon. My Lord occupies my heart like the sunlight occupies the daytime skies.” That is why in Yajurveda we find following shloka. शिवाय विष्णु रूपाय शिव रूपाय विष्णवे |शिवस्य हृदयं विष्णुं विष्णोश्च हृदयं शिवः || यथा शिवमयो विष्णुरेवं विष्णुमयः शिवः |यथाsन्तरम् न पश्यामि तथा में स्वस्तिरायुषि|यथाsन्तरं न भेदा: स्यु: शिवराघवयोस्तथा|| It means that Shiva is nothing but Vishnu and Vishnu is nothing but Shiva. Vishnu lives in the heart of Shiva while Shiva occupies the heart of Vishnu. Just like Vishnu contains Shiva Shiva contains Vishnu. “Bring them to me those who forget this eternal unity” is said by Yama. A person will be safe and long living only if he doesn't find differences in Shiva and Vishnu. Lord Shiva is seen sitting on tiger's hide signifies His mastery and full control over animalistic qualities such as Greed Lust Ignorance and Anger etc. It also signifies that the Lord is Pashupati the Lord of all the animals.

Once there was a Asura called Durg and the Goddess who killed him was called Durga. More commonly  when the buffalo asura Mahishasura was tormenting the Gods as he had a boon that he could be killed only by a woman; the Goddess created from the energies of all Gods and Goddess was called Durga.,Babu Roy,https://www.quora.com/profile/Babu-Roy

Now learn of these from Me. The place of action [the body] the performer the various senses the many different kinds of endeavor and ultimately the Supersoul -- these are the five factors of action. Whatever right or wrong action a man performs by body mind or speech is caused by these five factors Therefore one who thinks himself the only doer not considering the five factors is certainly not very intelligent and cannot see things as they are.Bg 18.13-16 These verses refute the notion that whatever happens on Earth is in accordance to Krishna’s wishes alone because He mentions the body the living entity the various senses and the endeavour as all being part of the equation for accomplishing any action. This does not mean that anything can happen that is against His wish because Supersoul is the fifth factor in whatever happens and if Supersoul doesn’t sanction something then it won’t happen. What it means is that whatever happens is sanctioned by Krishna. To give an example a father may not want their 17 year old son to smoke cigarettes and if push came to shove he could forbid him to do it in his house but he may allow it even if he would rather that his son didn’t. So some things are going on in his house which he sanctions but it is not his wish that they happen. This is similar to Krishna’s control over the activities in the material world. Whatever happens is sanctioned by Him but not everything is according to His wish. He would rather nobody suffered but if the living entities are determined to perform activities that cause themselves suffering He will allow it because some people will not learn any other way and the Lord wants everyone to learn one way or the other. He would prefer the easy way but being impartial He will not interfere with the living entity’s independence if he wants to learn the hard way.,Murari Das,https://www.quora.com/profile/Murari-Das-1

Yes He will be right by your side and this is equally valid for all The Hyms Mantras and Strotas of Lord Hanuman. Infact if you’re his devotee then he’ll always be by your side. It may happen that you forget him but He has such a kind and caring nature that he wont forget to look after you.I’ll narrate a tale regarding the power of sunderkand which I heard Some time ago :Once in a village( I ain’t able to recall the name) There lived a learned Brahman who was a great devotee of Lord Hanuman. He had mastered many books such as Veds Epics etc and He used to recite the sunderkand on a daily basis. He even used to organize sunderkand paath in the village many a times conveying everyone the message of Shri Ram and Lord Hanuman. There in that same village Lived a tantrik who had Mastered extremely powerful Tantra vidya and used to trouble the people a lot and he even Killed a few people with the help of his black magic. So it happened one day these two crossed path and had a huge fight where the tantrik threatened to kill the Brahmin but the Brahmin Rebuked him. At the end of the Verbal war The Tantrik vowed that the Brahmin wont See the next day’s sunrise and the Brahmin shrugged it off and accepted the challenge. The people told the Brahmin that The Tantrik has gained various powerful siddhis and he will surely.kill him. Nevertheless The Brahmin went home Telling everyone that He’ll be fine. But obviously human nature played here and the Brahmin was worried about the Powers of the Tantrik and his threats. But such a great devotee of Lord Hanuman he was that he didn’t emphasized much and straightway went to his home. At night after around 9 after having a bath and dinner he sat down and began the recitation of sunderkand. Meanwhile the tantrik began his ritual in the Graveyardsummoned evil spirits and sent them after the Brahmin.But none of the spirits were able to enter the Brahmin's homeas the sunderkand Recitation created an invisible armour around the Brahmin's house. The spirits tried their best and banged a lot on the door but no vail. The brahmin realized something was wrong but payed no heed. After some time The Brahmin began hearing loud screams from outside his home premises as if someone was beating up the evil spirits. These happened for a few moments and then dead silence of the night prevailed. The brahmin continued his sunderkand recitation till 5am next morning performed aarti and went to sleep.He woke up at around 10am and went outside to check out the scenario. He enquired about the Tantrikand what he heard was shocking : “dont you know what happened last night? The tantrik died in the Graveyard and the ones who killed him were his own evil spirits"" The Brahmin was shocked. He then realised everything that happened the screaming sounds he heard were none other but that of the evil spirits and the one who was beating them up was Lord Hanuman. The spirits became so frightened that they reversed their direction and killed their own master. The brahmin thanked lord Hanuman for saving his life.So you see this is what the Bhakti of lord Hanuman is capable of Not even the most powerful evil entities can harm you if you are a devotee of Lord Hanuman!!~TheRamBhakt",Daśanāmi Vaiṣṇava,https://www.quora.com/profile/Da%C5%9Ban%C4%81mi-Vai%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%87ava

I know it’s difficult but I want to marry my girlfriend who's Jewish and I want us to have a unified family. I also believe closer to Judaism’s view of Monotheism. Which rabbi can I speak to?Here are my thoughts:Ask her what she wants. If she doesn’t care maybe you don’t need to worry about it. According to Jewish law your children with her will be Jewish even if you don’t convert. You can still attend synagogue with your family and learn Hebrew the prayers the holidays etc.If you still want to convert you should probably convert to the same branch your girlfriend is. You would just call your local synagogue and find out if they have a conversion program. It’s usually at least 1 year or more of study and living the Jewish calendar year and you’ll be expected to learn to read Hebrew and if you’re not already circumcised that will also be an expectation. Even if you are already circumcised there is still a very easy ritual that will need to be done called hatafat dam brit.,Adam Reisman,https://www.quora.com/profile/Adam-Reisman

It includes everything from Atheism to Pantheism. Truly all inclusive. Anyone who came here as a migrant or a refugee lived here peacefully & prospered. We were the only ones to give refuge to Jews. Unlike some “peaceful religions”. Focus on practical meditative techniques which can make you a better & person instead of just few words with punishment of hell & rewards of heaven.

Ugadi :- Telugu new year Ugadi muggulu(designs) drawn in front of the house.Ugadi pachadi(pickel).. 6 tastes at the same time. Yummmm!!! Bathukamma :- A festival for women. Involves a lot of dancing & flowers.Etc. Then there's the usual.. Diwali :- Festival of lights celebrating the love of a beautiful couple. A husband's love for his wife & their people celebrating the return of their Queen.Holi :- Festival of colors celebrating a Child being saved from his own family.And a lot more.. Mind you it can be a faith but not a Religion as that would include commandments heaven hell etc. You can select a God/goddess and make it your personal/family diety or believe him/her to be the Supreme diety who created the universe.

Then comes along a white lady with her camera and start taking pictures the ladies got distracted and started posing for the camera to the end that the white women was directing them on how to stand to get the best light etc. And in the meantime bhava was lost. Who is to blame here? But then there is no guarantee that every Hindu who visits a temple has similar devotion. Nor is that all non-Hindus come to gawk as tourists. So it is a call the temples have to make there is no perfect solution to such.  In my opinion given my experience of Abrahamic religions where they think to pray to ""idols"" is bizarre and exotic. I rather fall on the other side of the line that they should not be allowed to visit the Shrines. A Hindu can visit a Church or a Mosque for a simple reason that a Hindu does not consider such a worship as pagan heathen or mushrik. The Hindu does not stand in judgement. But Abrahamics do stand in judgement upon other religions. I do not want to invite someone to my home knowing that their motives are thus. And I don't want my heritage to be gawked at or our practices - as though we are performing monkeys in a circus act. Sure there will be exceptions to this but it is near impossible to verify. So for now I think it is better policy to keep them away.  Be it USCIRF or people like Jeffery Kripal trusting them and giving them access has turned out to be a bad choice for us. For they end up demeaning what we value.  We should stop being suckers for the ""white person's opinion"" we are proud that they appreciate our art heritage etc. But every time this has lead to that particular art or custom being stripped of its dharmic moorings and marketed as a ""secularized"" exotic product and slowly appropriated.

(hitopadesha)Dharma has 12 components; 6 relating to self development and 6 relating to relationship with “others” — 1. Purity (saucham) — The first requisite of Dharma and the foundation is the cultivation of a pure and healthy body and hence a pure and healthy mind. It is incumbent upon the Hindu to bathe twice a day or at least every morning and maintain good hygiene. The rules of purity are quite complex and cover everything from physical hygiene and eating to ritual purification after such occasions as death and birth. 2. Sacrifice (yajña) — worship of God through the rituals that are prescribed in the various sacred texts (ie. Vedas and Agamas) 3. Austerity (tapah) — refers to simple living and the practice of meditation. 4. Self discipline (damah) — one should strive to control one's desires and behaviour avoid excesses and cultivate self- discipline which is the basis of civilisation. 5. Study (svadhyaya) — this concept refers to the Study of philosophy (investigation into the Truth) as well as self-study or introspection self analysis and cultivation of insight into one's true Self. 6. Contentment (shanti) — development of a peaceful disposition; being content with little and accepting whatever comes to one; be it pleasant or unpleasant with equanimity. 7. Non-violence (Ahimsa) — one should refrain from causing any injury to other living beings through word deed or thought. The premise is that the ātman (Self) in all beings is the same and therefore one should treat all other beings with the utmost compassion as one should deal with oneself. 8. Truth (satyam) — practice of truth in speech and harmony in action at all times. One should speak only that which is true and agreeable one should not needlessly say things that are hurtful even though they may be the truth. One's actions should be in concordance with what one professes. The practice of truth includes in it such virtues as straightforwardness frankness absence of deviousness and malice and so forth. 9. Charity (danam) — this has a twofold reference; one is the giving of charity to the needy as well as social works for the benefit of society as a whole. The other reference is to the gift of fearlessness to all creatures through cultivation of complete non-injury (ahimsa ) to any being in word deed or thought. 10. Non stealing (asteya) — one should refrain from taking anything that is not given. 11. Forgiveness (kshama) — and forbearance which comes from the cultivation of loving kindness to all beings. 12. Veneration for elders (gurusevana) — the term guru (preceptor) covers the parents elders and all those who teach something however insignificant it may be.,Rami Sivan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Rami-Sivan

Build a specific angle directed upwards at about 1.1 degrees serving as a wedge with a ball positioned over the wedge rolling against a backboard angled at about 45 degrees with the rail for the wedge angled a particular way on the board and the board rotated slightly in such a way where if the board is square the far side is elevated significantly but the near side is also elevated slightly but not as much and the near side of the board at the top is angled upwards compared to the far side of the top of the board so far as is possible. If you can figure out how to build these modularly it is designed to be a perpetual motion machine. These might sell for $1000000 each if they work to loop the ball on it’s own power in a circle.ABOVE: SWIVEL LEVER DEVICE (Experiment from 2018 - 2019) Swivel lever device. A counterweight is placed on the short end of a lever with the long end in a 2:1 ratio with the short end. A small basket is placed slightly inside the tip of the long end so that when a ball is moved very slightly diagonally upwards by the counterweight the ball is deflected by a panel or wedge inwards towards the basket. When the counterweight is approximately >2X - < 3X the mass of the ball (or in practice very close to 2.5X to slightly more) then once the ball reaches the basket it will lift the counterweight as the ball moves downwards diagonally with the lever following the same path backwards. With enough energy if the track is shallow enough the ball may be deflected perhaps due to only slight inward and outward motion to return to the beginning of the track where the same process will (or is designed to) repeat. These are designed to work as a perpetual motion machine as one unit and thus might sell for $1000000 if the loop repeats.(ABOVE: CAT-TRAP Experiment from December 3 2021) Cat-Trap or Modular Lever. Build a very shallow lever in about a 1.5: 1 ratio with the far end having a slightly inward-angled lightweight board. Build several of these in loop with each unit having a deflection just above the hinge of the lever. Each lever will have a >1.75X to <2.5X counterweight measured in ratio to a 1X ball which is meant to follow the chain of levers possibly using sidewalls to prevent the ball from escaping. The balls must be tall and lightweight but with the correct amount of mass and the levers must hinge solidly and with correct blocking at the top and bottom of motion. The counterweights must also be solidly attached with the correct amount of mass of about 2X the mass of the ball or perhaps slightly more depending on the structural mass of the lever. Remember the levers must be very shallow so that the momentum combined with the relatively high altitude of the midpoint of the ball allows the ball to press on the next shallow upward-and-downward hinged lever in this case moving inwards from the tip along each lever and deflecting. The energy from the counterweight because of the counterweight’s mass combined with the angle of the panel at the beginning of the lever is designed to keep the ball moving and even accelerating up to a certain speed as the ball is directed by the deflecting panels along the course around the levers. Since this is designed to function like a perpetual motion machine if built successfully it could be worth $1000000. …,Nathan Coppedge,https://www.quora.com/profile/Nathan-Coppedge

Following the directions of the brāhmaṇas they went to the bank of the Yamunā where they bathed and atoned for their sinful activities.  Purport:  In this verse the word bāla-hatyā-hata-prabhāḥ is to be particularly noted. The practice of killing children has existed in human society for a long time — since time immemorial — but in the days of yore it was very rarely performed. At the present moment however in this Age of Kali abortion — killing of the child within the womb — has become very common and sometimes a child is even killed after birth. If a woman performs such an abominable act she gradually loses all her bodily luster (bāla-hatyā-hata-prabhāḥ). It is also to be noted that the ladies who had committed the sinful act of administering poison to the child were very much ashamed and according to the directions of the brāhmaṇas they had to undergo atonement for killing the child. Any woman who has ever performed such an infamously sinful act must atone for it but no one now is doing that. Under the circumstances the women responsible must suffer in this life and the next. Those who are sincere souls after hearing this incident should refrain from such child-killing and should atone for their sinful activities by taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness very seriously. If one chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra without offenses all of one’s sinful actions are surely atoned for immediately but one should not commit such deeds again for that is an offense.,Ganapati Govind Das,https://www.quora.com/profile/Ganapati-Govind-Das

Where things get weird is when people try to generalize the characteristics of a Sun Sign as though it were the whole natal chart. Of course nobody’s chart contains only one sign so there’s necessarily some slippage due to the misapplication of the information about the signs. That natal Sun is important but most often it is not the key to the natal chart. There’s an Ascendant to consider and the Lord of the Ascendant (ruling planet of the rising sign). Aspects from any of the natal planets can make any planet more dominant in the profile of the native and very often that planet will not be the Sun and will not be in the same sign or house as the Sun.

At that point in time there was no Gopuram. 7.Between 1330 till 1370 Sri Ranganathar idol of Sri Rangam was kept here as there was no safe place other than the Hill they found after the attack of Malik Kafur on Sri Rangam.Till this time there is no account of Telugu or Kannada or other pilgrims to this temple. Attack on Sri Rangam Kanchi and Madurai brought Telugu Speaking Pallavas Kannada Speaking Chalukyas and Hoyslas together on the hills to see Sri Ranganathar and to liberate Tamil Country. 8.The extension of the temple structures even extends upto the 15th and 16th centuries. Endowmenting the villages started from Saluva Narasimha of Vijayanagara Empire in 1480 followed by the famous emperor Krishna Devearya and Achuta Raya. 9.Pushkarni steps are constructed by Tirumala Iyengar in 16th Century.After the defeat in Talikota in 1565 the Aravidu dyansty of Vijayanagara Empire lasted another 95 years and they patronsied the temple till 1660.

Both traditions are irrefutably nondual. Sufism is Islam. It is a very tolerant branch of Islam a very wonderful nondual mystical branch of Islam but it is Islam. And Islam is a monotheistic dualistic religion. Therefore Sufism’s ultimate truth is unity with God with the attributes of monotheistic faiths and at the same time formless also. As a result of this “combination” Sufism then promotes diversity in ideas about exactly what God is. There’s no one way to be a Sufi and probably no one type of end result when Fana is reached. This can be conflicting to some especially given that Sufism’s roots are in a very dualistic monotheistic tradition but I see it as diversity of opinion with the underlying unity which is good. I very much disagree with “universalists” who try to rip Sufism from its Islamic roots and “make it like Advaita”. Those who do this refuse to acknowledge Sufism’s deep roots in Islam and I think this is wrong. There should be no Zen without Buddhism hence there should be no Sufism without Islam. Advaita Vedanta on the other hand it’s roots are the Vedas and the Vedas are not monotheistic. The Vedas’ ultimate message is about the Primordial Essence/Consciousness. So in Advaita Vedanta reality is not God in the western Islamic/Abrahamic sense. Rather Advaita’s ultimate reality is formless Nirguna Brahman that which cannot be perceived by any of the six senses yet is the source from which the six senses manifest. And this formlessness is in all form so it doesn’t mean we are trying to escape from the world of form. We are still very much in the world and appreciate the world’s diversity but not of it. As a result of the above two paragraphs Sufism is about the heart and about love but in a much more passionately ecstatic way with monotheistic “overtones” and much dancing (i.e. “whirling dervish”) as part of its nonduality. Advaita Vedanta is also very much about the heart as the Vedas and Upanishads talk about the soma/nectar of the heart but it’s balanced with stillness dispassion (vairagya) and a still mind. So is Sufism similar to Advaita Vedanta? In many ways yes but in some significant ways no. The differences in my opinion are bigger than people and scholars like to think. I think Sufism is wonderful and so is Advaita Vedanta. I would not try to “know too much” and pick which one resonates with you more and dive into it.,Joe Publico,https://www.quora.com/profile/Joe-Publico-1

In fact he himself reincarnated to free a Brahmarakshasha from a curse by becoming his student and noting his teachings on dried leaves (as they were in the woods).

RelatedWho do religious Hindus believe the Vedas were revealed to and by whom?,https://www.quora.com/Who-do-religious-Hindus-believe-the-Vedas-were-revealed-to-and-by-whom,,First let me clear you all - Veda does not mean book or scriptures or words in Sanskrit. Veda means knowledge. The knowledge is there since the very existence. Revealed means- make known to others which was previously unknown (secret). Veda (knowledge) is not secret because that is the root the knowledge of this very existence. Hence can not be revealed but written down by families of sages (rishis). There are four Vedas - Rigveda Yajurveda Samaveda and Atharvaveda. All the Vedas written in Hymns along with associated commentaries on liturgy ritual and mystical explanations or interpretations. Rigveda is the ancient one first written by the greatest family of sages. They have hymns by members of the same clan in each book; but other clans are also represented in the Rigveda. In all ten families of rishis account for more than ninety five percent of the Rigveda. Name of the rishis are 1. Angiras 2. Kanva 3. Vasishtha 4. Vishvamitra 5. Atri 6. Bhrgu 7. Kashyapa 8. Grtsamada 9. Agastya and 10. Bharata. All these rishis are devoted their entire life to explore on these three elements of existence. The Brahman the Atman(soul) and the Prakriti(nature). This Quora answer section is not enough to write down all details so if you want to learn about Veda either you read all those books (but it is nearly impossible to devote times due to everyone busy running behind money) or try to read Satyarth Prakash (Satyarth Prakash: Opening Notes - Satyarth Prakash (English)) to know the essence of Veda.,Pabitram Sadangi,https://www.quora.com/profile/Pabitram-Sadangi

The key difference is the disregard that China developed towards India as the way history began to be viewed in China through the prism of the Chinese Communist Party. In order to establish a new national order the idea of the incredible influence India had traditionally held in China was negated or tilted to be far less profound than the reality of of this past showed. Indian Civilization may be older than that found in China and it was Indian Civilization which influenced China far more than China influenced India. Indian Philosophy Sciences Mathematics and Indian Ethics spread to China beginning in a very slow process in the centuries before Indian Unification in 260 B.C. and accelerated after this. The very basis of many of the concepts of what we today call “Asian Values” came from the Mauryan Age in India. Incredibly a vivid description of the wonder that was Ancient India comes from the voice of Ancient China.A complex based upon Ancient Indian Astronomy and Time Keeping. Jantar Mantar Rajasthan India. Indian Astronomy which was very different than what was found in China before the period of the Great Interchange between India and China would profoundly influence Chinese Astronomy. Not only do Chinese records show this clearly but also record an Indian Astronomer known in China as Qutan Xida who was the Director of the Tang Dynasties National Astrological Observatory. His true name was Gotamma Siddha and he assisted in the translation of his many works on astronomy into Chinese. His efforts also reinforced the knowledge the Chinese had of Indian Scholars and Scientists such as Aryabhata and Brahmagupta. The works showed the pioneering of Indian Mathematicians in developing the trigonometric Sine and its use in accurate time keeping.Prime Minister Modi honors Ancient Indian Social Reformer and Pioneer of Democratic Principles Basavanna. In later times Arab Mathematicians would simply translate the the Indian Surya Siddhanta and the knowledge would be transmitted to Europe. For centuries the Indian Decimal system and number system would be attributed to Arab Mathematicians until European Scholars became aware of the original Indian Texts which were far more ancient and actually attributed to by Arab Scholars such as Mohmmad Al-Fazari and Persian Indologist Al-Beruni. Yet it would be the realization which would come from Chinese records which would actually finally give justice to Ancient India for the wonder it was for so many records were lost in India during the period of Islamic invasion. The Unification of India in 260 B.C. by Emperor Piyadaasi Ashoka established the world’s largest empire at this time by geography and population. A standardization of weights and measures created an economic zone unrivaled on the globe. Emperor Ashoka had seen the fringes of his vast Empire and realized that these areas were not only less populated but far less developed in terms of philosophy science and medical knowledge. He came to to the conclusion that he had to alleviate the suffering of the people of these areas and those abroad by spreading knowledge. India already had a flourishing system of medicine known as Aryurvedic Medicine. dentistry surgeries and even inoculations were performed routinely in Ancient India.Faxian. Travels to India After Emperor Ashoka sent emissaries all over the known world bringing with them Indian Buddhism Philosophy and Scientific knowledge. These emissaries would also invite populations to come and study in India Chinese students journeyed over vast largely sparsely populated areas to reach the universities of Ancient India. They would generally travel around the Himalayas and enter India through the passes of North Western India. The frontier they crossed showed them the very fringe of the Pan-Indian World. As their journey neared its end they would cross from what is now Afghanistan and then cross the Indus River. They would be astounded by the civilization they saw as it was heavily populated and developed. One city passed just as quickly as another came. For some their journey had already ended as they went to study at Taxila University for others their destinations lay deeper into the Pan-Indian World. Puphagiri Mahavihara Odisha India. Puphagiri Mahavihara in the Indian State of Odisha was described as one of the oldest and most established of Indian Universities by Chinese Traveler and Student Hiuen Tsang in 639 A.D. The University was spread out over 143 acres. Excavation at the site today confirms that it was indeed a place built long ago as it has been dated to the 2nd Century B.C. Incredibly the University was only known through ancient texts until a local Professor Harish Chandra Prusty found the site by accident. The Archeological Survey of India had in vain been searching for the site since the 1950’s. Though many clues were found the only purpose they served was to disqualify misidentified sites. It would Professor Prusty’s discovery of a seal with the name of the University inscribed in Brahmi Script which would finally shine light on one of Ancient India’s long lost seats of learning. Nalanda University Bihar India. Chinese Students would also document the Academic Masterpiece of Ancient India which was Nalanda University in the State of Bihar. To come to study here was an achievement in itself. And like Puphagiri Mahavihara the academics taught were extensive. More than 6 Million books were present in its massive libraries. The scientific literary and mathematical achievement of Ancient India was here. Original manuscripts from Indian Playwright Ashwagosh were present along with the works of Kalidas Aryabhata and Panini. It was a University which had been Endowed by Emperor Pyadaasi Ashoka himself. Chinese travelers would record the extensive staff and the education they received there. They would take copies of thousands of manuscripts back to China and continue to correspond with their friends and Professors in India sometimes for the rest of their lives. The influence that Ancient India had on China from the Third Century B.C. to the destruction of India’s Universities and final burning of Nalanda by an Islamic Fanatic known as Kilji around 1157 A.D. is a matter which simply is profound. For no two civilizations in recorded human ever interfaced the way Ancient India did with Ancient China. Sanskrit language still survives in many Chinese terms even the word Mandarin comes from the Indian Sanskrit “Mantri” or “Minister” hence Mandarin equates to the language of Governance. The Sanskrit word “Dhyan” or “Concentration” would become “Chan” in Mandarin Chinese and “Zen” by the time it reached Japan. Hindu mythology would travel and maintain it's essence with elements changed in name but still recognizable in China and Japan. The Pagoda is Indian in origin and today very much part of the skyline of China and the far east.Vispana Pagoda Mumbai India. To look at two civilizations such as India and China and ascertain which one was more advanced can only be done deductively. It was Ancient China who sent students to study in India and it was Ancient China who called India “The Celestial Storehouse of Knowledge” it is quite apparent that India was a sophisticated Civilization. At the same time the viewpoint of Indians at this time could be very straight forward as noted by many Chinese Students and travelers who crossed the frontier of India near Taxila including Dao Jing who journeyed along with Faxian he would state in a third person form of writing: “The crowd of Monks came out and asked from which Kingdom they were come they replied ‘from the land of Han (China)’ They would reply ‘Strange’ said the Monks with a sigh ‘that men of a border country should come here in search of our laws!’. they then said……’followers of our system’” The statements of Chinese travelers would correlate over during Great Interchange many would view India as a Utopia and the words of Faxian would become valued in his own time as his views were impartial and held great importance when he would return back to China. Traveling widely in India during the rule of Chandragupta II (400–410 A.D.) he would gain and even greater reverence for India than he came with and it seems India exceeded his already high expectations. He would state: “The people are very well off without poll tax or official restrictions.. The Kings govern without corporal punishment and criminals are fined according to circumstance.” His description of this contrasted to China at the time and he would remark on the free medical care which was received by Indians at the time and of high quality. Faxian would record India as being a virtual utopia at this time with flourishing trade and governance which was exceptional. His various writings would inspire future Chinese students and travelers to seek India. Faxian would in the first time in Chinese History refer to a foreign nation India as the “Middle Kingdom” and place China on a secondary level. The respect and awe he held for India did not fade for Faxian.By act of the Indian Parliament in 2010 Nalanda University is being rebuilt and has started functioning after nearly 10 centuries. When looking at the relationship of Ancient India and Ancient China the very records which China has left indicate its own opinion of India. Ancient India held a unique place in the world after the Mauryan Dynasty and the later Gupta Dynasty. India’s place in the world was not simply because of its economic prosperity which was unmatched it was India’s Scientific. Philosophical achievement and the combination of humanity reflected in nearly every facet of governance at that time. Ancient India was a place where trade occurred with Ancient Persia Ancient Greece and later Rome. Ancient India unlike Empires which based their identity on ability to conduct conquest and expansion had realized it possessed something far more than this for it spared no effort to spread its vision of Enlightened Coexistence. The quest to alleviate suffering as much as possible became a pursuit Ancient India engaged in like no civilization before it. Chinese travelers to India very much understood this they came to India to gain the knowledge of a civilization which magnanimously shared its enlightenment with the world without inhibition. Their opinion still is present in their own words.Footnotes: [1] The argumentative Indian Amartya Sen [2] India a History John Keay [3] Early Chinese and Indian History,Baba Vickram Aditya Bedi,https://www.quora.com/profile/Baba-Vickram-Aditya-Bedi

The man from the second story window refused saying “the Lord will provide.” The water continued to rise eventually washing the house and the man away.

Here is what he said she did/went through. She studied in a Hindi medium school till 16. After that she worked hard on her English skills. When everyone backed down listening about Aishwarya Rai being a participant too she stayed to compete. With all the courage. She did not have a designer gown for the event and got it stitched from some local shop. Neither she had hand gloves. In fact her mother used socks to make hand glove for her. Efforts of days and nights finally brought that night of ‘Overnight success’.In the age of quick fix and instant Maggi world we have forgotten that nothing good happens without patience. It requires years of inside work to celebrate what we see one day on the outside. You ask What is the synonym of magic? It surely has to be patience and perseverance.

RelatedWhen was the Sudarshana Chakra used by Lord Krishna?,https://www.quora.com/When-was-the-Sudarshana-Chakra-used-by-Lord-Krishna,https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1ef5ac81901dabfcc320df483b129c90-lq,The Sudarshan Chakra is considered as the most powerful weapon in the Universe and so is Shiva's Trishul- they are at par with each other. There are stories about how the two collided with each other and were stopped at that time by Shiva and Vishnu. However since this question is about Lord Krishna's using the Sudarshan Chakra not Lord Vishnu so I will try to keep those stories out of it. Let's see what all Krishna did with his Chakra. So there's a story of Krishna getting the Chakra from Lord Parshuram and another one from Agni. Krishna rarely used his Sudarshan chakra since anyone getting killed by it would reach Moksha! Let's see when Krishna used it:When Yudhishthira did his inauguration of his capital as Indraprastha he decided to honour Krishna by washing his feet first instead of any other elder. This enraged Duryodhana's supporters. They suggested it should be Bhishma or Dhritarashtra or someone else of higher birth not a Yadav.Among these angry folks was a guy called Shishupal. He was Krishna's cousin. He was born with 4 hands and his mother got a message from the skies that the one whose touch would make Shishupal a normal person (with 2 hands) would kill him! When Krishna touched him he became normal thus scaring his Aunt. Krishna promised his Aunt that he would forgive 100 mistakes of Shishupal and if still Shishupal didn't change his ways Krishna would need to teach him a lesson.Shishupal had wanted to marry Rukmini earlier. Rukmini sent a message to Krishna (she loved him) and Krishna took her away from the forced wedding and married her. When Shishupal tried to stop them Krishna defeated him. Shishupal wanted to take revenge and he got this opportunity to take out his anger. He started insulting Krishna. And Krishna was silent. He was counting till 100!At 100th Krishna took his Sudarshan Chakra and chopped off Shishupal's head thus scaring the whole audience. Shishupal was the incarnation of Jay ( the door keeper of Lord Vishnu's home Vaikuntha and had become a human due to a curse) and got released from his human body. This was the 3rd incarnation of Jay- he was earlier Hiranyakashipu (killed by Narsimha) and Ravan (killed by Ram) in his previous births. This death finally got him liberation from the curse of being born on earth.When Krishna's chakra returned back to him it cut his finger too. Out of so many people standing there the first one to reach to him was his closest friend: Draupadi. She didn't wait for anything grabbed the end of her saree (she was elegantly dressed as Queen she was the hostess of the whole ceremony clad in costliest garments) tore a piece of it to tie on the bleeding finger of Krishna. Krishna promised he would return each thread of the cloth one day when she would need it utmost. He did so in the infamous dice game in which Dushasana tried to disgrace Draupadi by pulling her clothes- Krishna heaped her with tons of clothes. When no one comes to your help only Krishna does due to your own Karma. Draupadi had not bothered about her costly materialistic things her love towards Krishna was pure so Krishna took care of her wellbeing till the end.The time when Krishna actually took out his Sudarshan Chakra but didn't use it are in fact 2 instances just before and during the war:Krishna tried to act as peacekeeper with Duryodhana but he planned to put him in the jail! Enraged Krishna showed his Virat Rupa took out his Sudarshan but didn't use it.When Bhishma was angry during the war on Krishna (that's a long story on how Krishna managed to break Bhishma's vow of killing the Pandavas by 5 powerful arrows He got it stolen) he decided to break Krishna's promise of not picking up weapons. He showered Arjuna with too many arrows the next day. Krishna actually took out his Sudarshan Bhishma wanted to die at that moment because he knew he would get Moksha! Arjun was embarrassed because he was still not fighting properly with Bhishma he loved his Grandfather. He stopped Krishna and then the final fight between Arjun and Bhishma continued.The last time when someone actually saw Sudarshan in full action was Belalsen. He was a fierce warrior and son/grandson (different versions) of Bhima. Krishna didn't want him to join the war since he was capable of killing whole Kauravas in a single day. Krishna's task was to get the whole Yuga to come to an end so all warriors on both sides had to die. Belalsen however wanted to see the war after he was tricked into not joining the war. His head was kept on top of a high pole from which he could see whole war. Krishna promised that in case his head remained in position till war ended Krishna would put it back on his body thus making him alive again.After that war everyone was boasting about how many people they killed. Bhima wanted to claim that he did maximum damage to Kauravas and Arjun too. So Krishna asked them to ask Belalsen.Belalsen laughed and said “What killing? All I saw was people just dancing about throwing their hands and feet around. Then came the Sudarshan Chakra and kept chopping heads of the whole army of both sides! It was all Krishna only!”An enraged Bhima gave a blow to the pillar and Belalsen's head fell off! He died. Bhima's repentance could not revive him at all…So that's some stories about Krishna and his Sudarshan Chakra… There might be more can't recall any at this moment. Edit 1: Thanks Bhabani Mohapatra for reminding me about the last story of Krishna's use of Sudarshan Chakra. So here it goes: 4. When Gandhari (mother of the 100 Kauravas who died in Mahabharata war) saw the whole Kuruclan destroyed she was angry with Krishna. She knew it was his support that made Pandavas rise and win the war. She was a very pious woman she cursed Krishna that his clan (the Yaduvansha) would also be destroyed like her clan the KuruVansha. Krishna accepted the curse. After some years of the war Krishna's clan folks fell into wrong ways. They started fighting among themselves. Krishna sent them to a forest called Prabhas Tirtha. He told them to fight some demon there to prove their powers. In reality there was no demon it was Krishna's illusion. The sons and grandsons of Krishna started killing each other falling into this trap they mistook each other as the demon! The last surviving member was the eldest son of Krishna and Rukmini: Pradyumna. He was the incarnation of Kamdeva (Lord Shiva had burnt this fellow to ashes when he had tried to break his meditation at the request of Devas: that's another story for some other time). Krishna remembered Gandhari's curse and chopped off his head with the Sudarshan Chakra thus ending his very own creation his very own family on earth. At this moment Sudarshan Chakra realised that it's task was over on earth for Krishna Leela and it vanished from earth never to be seen in that era. It merged back into the divine from of Krishna Lord Vishnu.,Ajita Barik,https://www.quora.com/profile/Ajita-Barik
अहमेव गतिस्तेषां निराशीः कर्मकारिणाम् ॥ 12-350-34 ॥ (Shri Krshna said) “O Arjuna there are four categories of people who are my bhaktas. Among them the Ekaantins (followers of the Pancharaatra philosophy) who worship me with the exclusion of all other devatas are indeed great.” -Mahaabhaarata Shaanti Parva Adhyaaya 350 Shlokas 33–34 Nonetheless Tattvavadis are an exception to this since Shripaada Madhvacharya authored a set of Aagama Shaastras with provisions for worshiping Shri Shiva Paarvati Devi Shri Ganesha Shri Skanda etc. and installing their deities in Vaishnava temples since it has not been covered in the Vaishnava Aagamas. For this reason there are Shiva lingas in the Madhva Mathas and Maha-Shivaraatri is celebrated by Maadhva Vaishnavas.  Credits to Shrimaan Priyansh for the second image. Shripaada Madhvacharya has also written a mantra for Shri Rudra to be recited by Maadhva Vaishnavas everytime during sandhyaavandanam. This is known as the ‘Shiva Dhyaaya Mantra’ and is written in the Shri Tantra Saarasangraha one of the works of Shripaada Madhvacharya that deals with the worship of devatas other than Shri Vishnu.  Not just this but Maadhva Vaishnavas also run the Dharmasthala Shri Manjunaatha Svaami temple a famous temple of Shri Shiva Shri Ganapati and Shri Skanda in Karnataka. The temple’s worship was initiated by the 16th century Maadhva saint Svaami Vaadiraaja Teertha Shripaadagalu.

As I discuss in this answer about the birth of the Kauravas Gandhari was pregnant with the Kauravas for two years. Dhritarashtra was worried that Gandhari would never give birth so as a precaution he decided to have a son with a Vaishya woman as described in chapter of the Adi Parva of the Mahabharata. In any case as I discuss in this answer Yuyutsu was a virtuous individual who switch to the Pandava side in the Mahabharata war and he served as a regent when the Pandavas left their kingdom to Arjuna's grandson Parikshit. And in addition to his 101 sons Dhritarashtra also had a daughter named Duhsala. She was born the same way as the 100 Kauravas as I discuss in this answer. And she married Jayadratha a king who fought on the Kaurava side infamous for blocking the Pandavas from rescuing Arjuna's son Abhimanyu during the Mahabharata war.Hope this helps you:),Bharghavi Ganesan,https://www.quora.com/profile/%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%BF-%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%A3%E0%AF%87%E0%AE%9A%E0%AE%A9%E0%AF%8D-Bharghavi-Ganesan

Such a man is incapable of being oppressed by any creature. He enjoys the confidence of all living beings. He always enjoys the praise of the pious. The virtuous Narada has said that that man who wishes to multiply his own flesh by eating the flesh of other creatures meets with disaster.

Therefore O King know that the discarding of meat is the highest refuge of religion of the celestial region and of happiness. Abstention of injury [to others] is the highest religion. It is again the highest penance. It is also the highest truth from which all duty emanates. (Mahabharata Anu.115.21-23)""Flesh cannot be had from grass or wood or stone. Unless a living creature is killed it cannot be procured. Hence is the fault of eating flesh. The celestials who live upon Svaha Svadha and nectar are given to truth and sincerity.

(Mahabharata Anu.115.24-25)""If there were nobody who ate flesh then there would be nobody to slay living creatures. The man who slays living creatures kills them for the sake of the person who eats flesh. If flesh were not considered as food there would then be no destruction of living creatures. It is for the sake of the eater that the destruction of living entities is carried on in the world. Since O you of great splendor the period of life is shortened by persons who kill living creatures or cause them to be killed it is clear that the person who seeks his own good should give up meat altogether. Those dreadful persons who are engaged in the destruction of living beings never find protectors when they are in need. Such persons should always be molested and punished even as beast of prey. (Mahabharata Anu.115.29-32)""That man who seeks to multiply his own flesh by (eating) the flesh of others has to live in this world in great anxiety and after death has to take birth in indifferent races and families. High Rishis given to the observance of vows and self-control have said that abstention from meat is worthy of praise productive of fame and Heaven and a great satisfaction itself. This I heard formerly O son of Kunti from Markandeya when that Rishi discoursed on the sins of eating flesh.

He who does not himself eat flesh but approves of an act of slaughter becomes stained with the sin of slaughter.

That wretched man who following the path of religious rites and sacrifices as laid down in the Vedas would kill a living creature from a desire to eats its flesh will certainly go to hell. That man who having eaten flesh abstains from it afterwards acquires great merit on account of such abstention from sin. He who arranges for obtaining flesh he who approves of those arrangements he who kills he who buys or sells he who cooks and he who eats it [acquire the sin of those who] are all considered as eaters of flesh. [Therefore] that man who wishes to avoid disaster should abstain from the meat of every living creature.

He who practices severe austerities for a century and he who abstains from meat are both equally meritorious. This is my opinion.

In this world there is nothing that is dearer to a creature than his life. Hence one should show mercy to the lives of others as he does to his own life. Forsooth O son flesh has its origin in the vital seed. There is great sin attached to its eating as indeed there is merit in abstaining from it.

(Mahabharata Anu.116.19)""Hence a person of purified soul should be merciful to all living creatures. That man O king who abstains from every kind of meat from his birth forsooth acquires a large space in the celestial region. They who eat the flesh of animals who are desirous of life are themselves [later] eaten by the animals they eat. This is my opinion. Since he has eaten me I shall eat him in return. This O Bharata forms the character as Mamsah [meaning flesh] of Mamsah [me he or ""me he"" will eat for having eaten him]. The destroyer is always slain. After him the eater meets with the same fate.

Common examples of this theory are: A gold ring being nothing other than gold; A clay pot being nothing other than clay; A wave being nothing other than water. In all of these examples the form (ring; pot; wave) is nothing but the substance appearing to be something new and different. But nothing additional has been created other than a name which is an arbitrary sound that only refers to the substance in that particular form. For instance when a gold ring is fashioned there is not suddenly gold plus a new substance called ring. There is not three ounces of gold plus an additional ounce of ring. There is only ever gold. In relation to the world Advaita Vedanta teachers such as Gaudapada in light of Vedic verses such as “All this is [universe] is Brahman alone (Chandogya Upanshad 3.14.1) came to the conclusion that what appeared to be an actual real creation was in fact just a transient “manifestation” of one’s own Self (Atman) i.e. Brahman. They realized “Aha! The world is the ring. Brahman is the gold. I thought I was a ring but I am gold itself! I am Brahman.” To summarize: Advaita Vedanta based on statements from the Veda says that all that exists is Brahman. Brahman is one without a second. It is non-dual (advaita). Because there is nothing other than Brahman and because nothing can exist outside of Brahman due to its infinite all-pervasiveness then nothing can actually be created. Yes Brahman can appear as anything and everything. And it does which is a plain fact of everyday life. But like the ring nothing new nothing additional is actually created. There is still only Brahman which like the gold to the ring remains fundamentally unchanged despite the appearance of the world. Creation therefore is only “as-if.” And this is Ajati Vada in a nutshell. I hope this helps :),Vishnudeva Sanders,https://www.quora.com/profile/Vishnudeva-Sanders

In classical terms he is the supreme “God” of the created universe. He is also called Hiraṇyagarbha the golden womb from which all creatures are born. Agni shares some attributes with Prajāpati because he is called viśām patih i.e. the lord of the people gaṇapati i.e. the lord of the creatures as well as bṛhaspati and brahmaṇaspati. The most famous hymn for Prajāpati is the Hiraṇyagarbha Sūktam (RV 10.121) which begins with: हिरण्यगर्भः समवर्तताग्रे भूतस्य जातः पतिरेक आसीत् । स दाधार पृथिवीं द्यामुतेमां कस्मै देवाय हविषा विधेम ॥ “Hiraṇyagarbha was born first before the beginning of the universe and he became the one lord of all creatures.

This is the water that rushed into Shri Kedarnath valley. This climate change is due to human activities which includes emission of gases like Carbon dioxide Hydrogen Sulfide etc.Non Eco-Friendly Development : While promoting the development works in area the government never cared about the natural ecosystem present there. Revenue is not everything. You need to maintain the balance. There is a difference between a tourist spot and a religious shrine. Bhagwan Mahadev Himself resides there and people want to tour Shri Kedarnath as a tourist spot!Building Dams and Stopping the Natural Flow of the River : Unabated construction of dams was one of the main reasons that amplified the destruction caused in the 2013 flood. But the government is still following the same policies which invited the disaster.Not Having a Proper Disaster Rescue Team : During the flood there wasn’t any team of NDRF(or related organisations). Even if they were present their number was less. If there would have been a proper setup it could have saved thousands of devotees. We are grateful to our Indian Defense Force which saved hundreds of lives putting their own lives in danger. To all the soldiers who are reading this answer we Indians are indebted to your efforts sir and madam.Removing Devi Mandir by the government : Indian spirituality is not a blind faith 🙂 There was a temple of Ma Dhari Devi in that area. The government displaced that temple for construction works. There were huge protests by the Devi-bhakts. Let me tell you one thing. The ancient Indian temples are not just something made of bricks and clay. They are Spiritual Centers where the spiritual energy is reserved for the welfare of the mankind and devotees. The government delocalised the temple and the very next day the valley was flooded!There were a lot of vehicles in the area polluting the divine space. Basically the humans and the government both were exploiting the Nature as much as they can. Nature always balances the situation and that resulted in the massive disaster.Now I am coming to the main answer. You have put the blame on Lord Shiva that He caused the floods and didn’t even save the devotees! Well done humans! Okay but let me answer this question too.First of all we need to understand some concepts of Hinduism. There is a universal Law of Karma that governs us all. Now I am not saying 100% devotees are like this but let me tell you what kind of people go in a temple. Always remember every person going in a temple is not a devotee. I personally know many people who have multiple girl friends. They talk dirty things with them. They eat meat. They abuse each other. There souls and minds are devoid of any purity and are filled entirely with lust jealousy and hate. But they regularly go to the temple of Shri Hanuman because temples are merely tourist spots for them. 60% of them visit Shri Kedarnath as either as a tourist or to ask something from Shiva. Now tell me where is bhakti!Every person has his/her past life karma. Those who ask to explain the Law of Karma let me tell you it is not a child's play to explain it. It took 12 years of meditation for Shri Gautam Buddha to understand the Law of Karma. Ancient sages who realised the Divine said “ब्रह्मा सत्यं जगत मिथ्या” means God is true and the world is an illusion. They got this knowledge after years of meditation. Now the atheists who always want to remain in their comfort zones they question this!Law of karma is applicable to all. Even God is not allowed to refuse it. The greatest devotees of the God and the incarnations of God like Shri Ram and Shri Krishna suffered because of the Law of Karma. I will give examples from both their lives but this is the beauty of this great Sanatana Dharma! There is a single law and it is applicable to God and men alike. When Shri Ram incarnated he was exiled to the jungle. There he killed Vali without a direct combat. Although the arrow hit Vali’s chest in front but this was immoral according to the Law of Karma. Vali had the boon that whoever will fight him half of the power of his enemy will go to Vali. Hiding and killing him from back was the only way to kill him.Karma showed its effect and Shri Vishnu paid it back when he incarnated as Shri Krishna. Vali was born as a bheel (tribal shooter) and by mistake he shot an arrow at Shri Krishna and He left his human body.So what Shri Vishnu did in his incarnation as Shri Rama He paid for it in His next incarnation as Shri Krishna. Now let me tell you the story of a great devotee who lived his life in a miserable condition. He was Shri Ramkrishna Paramhansa a great devotee of Goddess Kali and the guru of Swami Vivekananda ji.If you read his biography you will be in tears. He was a great devotee. He loved Goddess Kali like his mother. He was such a great devotee that the Goddess Herself appeared in front of him. He used to eat his food with her and always lived in a trance (bhaav-samadhi). He was extremely advanced spiritually yet he died of cancer even after being a good devotee(he took karma of an alcoholic person out of comapassion for him). Karma never spares anyone but due to the grace of the Goddess Kali he got salvation. Shri Swami Vivekananda died of tuberculosis.shri Raman Maharishi died of a cancer. mata Mira Bai was given poison. You can see the lives of the devotees were not easy.they all were great beings but they took karmas of others out of compassion and their body suffered It still isn’t. There no freedom from the Law of Karma. Lord shiva is the god who drank poison which was the result of negative karms of everyoneto save his children he drank itShiva only saves you he never punish you your own karms punish you What about the devotees who lost their lives in the Kedarnath tragedy? Before explaining it let me tell you something about Kashi (Banaras ) and Ujjain. These two auspicious places are guarded by Bhagwan Kaal Bhairav an “ansh” of Shiva. Whosoever dies in such sacred places like Kedarnath Kashi Ujjain she/he directly gets salvation. Go there and you will meet people who will tell you their experiences.Before death Bhagwan Kaal Bhairav appears and put the person in extreme pain and the suffering clears all the previous karmas of the person. He achieves liberation. So all those who died there they surely achieved freedom from this cycle of birth and death. Now since you are blaming Shiva for all these tragedies let me tell you something about Shiva.He is present in every single particle in universe. He is the omnipresent Lord. Lord Shiva did not made His temple at that place. We devotees made His temple. It was our fault to build His temple in that disaster- prone area. So if you want to blame then blame us. Shiva is like the gravity. He is present everywhere but if you jump from a building you will die. It is not because of gravity. It is because of your own stupidity. In the same way blame those Pandavas of Mahabharat and the sages who worshiped Shiva at that place. Blame the devotees like us who visit the place. That area is an earthquake-prone area still we made a temple there that costed human lives.Shiva is the god who punished Yamaraja Himself to save his devotee Markanday from death. The same Markandey Rishi created the Mahamrityunjay mantra. You can not blame Lord Shiva for it. Recently the Australian government decided to kill 10000 camels stating that they are responsible for carbon emission. I mean we humans are so insane that we blame everyone from animals to God for these incidents but where is our responsibility?In that incident Shri Kedarnath temple was saved by a miraculous stone named Bhima Shila. Just before the flood was about to hit the temple this rock came in between the water and the temple thus diverting the direction of the flood. It saved the temple otherwise all the other buildings collapsed and this 4000 years old temple is still standing high.You can see the breadth of the rock in this picture. It is exactly equal to the breadth of the wall of the temple. In Hinduism the body is not permanent. The soul is. So death is not ultimate. It is just a passage to new life. Creation and destruction is constant and simultaneous process. Having said that I would like to add that saving such places is very important as these places will give salvation to millions of people. Let me tell you the power of Shiva devotees.The Mughal ruler Aurangzeb tried everything to eliminate the very name of Kashi but till date it is known as “Mahadev ki Kashi”. Tell me one civilization apart from Sanatan Dharma that survived the Islamic invasion. “ Shiv ki kashi” todayThe civilization of Mesopotamia Greece Egypt and Chinese perished from the face of this earth but the Sanatana Dharma is still standing high and it is just because of our true nature of spirituality. Do not blame Shiva for these things just because we have made His temple on that place. Creation and destruction are the essence of this universe and the materialistic people will never understand this. Thank you. Har Har Mahadev.

I am a student of Puranas and consider myself not learned enough to answer your questions.  However I have understood the essence of Shiva and perhaps make an attempt to share my miniscule understanding for your understanding. “Purana” is a Sanskrit expression which I have seen largely misunderstood than it is properly understood. It is made out of two words “Pura” and “Nava.” Pura is “city or the place where citizens live” and Nava is “new.” Therefore the literary meaning of Purana is “what is new happening in the city” as against the common belief that it relates to “everything that pertains to old.” Puranas are the incidents/stories that happened in Puras as and when they happened and recorded for benefits of those who want to learn from it. Most of the Puranas which we read today are those chronicles of incidents/stories that have happened “new” at the time of their recordings which have happened before the huge gap of time. “Shiva” is another Sanskrit expression which denotes “Essence.” It can also be understood as “Sat” again the same meaning out of which the expression “Sathya” or truth evolved. Shiva is “that which propels on its own” without an external force. It is because of “Shiva” who/that pervades inside every living organism it is self propelling or it can be simply said that “they are alive.” The moment “Shiva” escapes/leaves from a body it becomes “Shava” or “that which is devoid of Shiva” and hence it cannot propel as it did when Shiva was present. “Sat/Shiva” or the “essence” is the only thing that “stays” and everything else disintegrates into “Pancha Boothas” or the Five Elements with which they are created and hence “that which remains or stays” and that which stays is “Truth” and everything else is an illusion because they ultimately vanishes or un-manifests. Why they vanish or un-manifest? It is because everything other than Shiva is made out of Pancha Boothas and therefore they have to go back to Pancha Boothas for re-creation or recycling. Shava therefore as per the Hindu rituals is consigned to flames so that its ashes can be useful in re-creation. Shiva is termed as “Ajan” or ""that has not been subjected to birth or already existed"" in Vedas and hence it has not come out of Pancha Boothas which formed when universe was created. Shiva therefore has a mighty significance in Hindu Puranas because it is the retainer/destroyer of life or the life itself and hence Shiva is always depicted physically in “huge form.”  I am of the opinion that several of the stories depicted in Puranas including Shiva Purana have to be read to know the “essence” of those stories than simply to enjoy the stories per se which seems to be case now. Every story depicted has a meaning and it conveys “a scientific truth” which can only be understood if we learn them in that perspective.

Anything that you would do for your boyfriend don’t give it to him. Because right now even if you aren’t in a relationship you are already giving him that. So he is thinking why do I need to be in a relationship with her if she already gives me everything that I would get if I’m in a relationship with her. Basically he gets everything without any strings attached. So when he goes out with another girl or has sex with her you can’t be upset or freak out because you don’t have the right your not his girlfriend. That’s why don’t give him any special treatment as a boyfriend. Because he is not your boyfriend. If he sees the change how you are treating him he will probably miss it and want to be your boyfriend ^^,Luna Lee,https://www.quora.com/profile/Luna-Lee-60

The word “pagan” means a country religion based not on the revelations of prophets but on a cultural tradition going back into the mists of time with many sources and many gods of different natures. Which to me suggests that Hinduism is by far the biggest and most successful pagan religion. Of course the word has dismissive overtones.

Since Valmiki Ramayana shows Rama like a normal prince fighting to save his kidnapped wife he wrote this agnipariksha incident like a normal agnipariksha process. Source:Valmiki Ramayana - Yuddha Kanda But according to Ramcharitamanas by tulsidas Rama created a maya sita(illusion of sita) before the kidnapping incident and kept the original Sita under the protection of Agni deva. And the reason behind agnipariksha was to take original Sita back from Agni deva. Maya Sita entered in the fire then Agni deva came out with original Sita and handed over to Rama. Since Ramcharitamanas shows Rama as Par brahm and Rama was known about his divinity from start tulsidas wrote the divine reasons behind agnipariksha incident. Ramcharitamanas is the most accepted by all hermits and sages of Hinduism. Tulsidas wrote about Agnipariksha :श्रीखंड सम पावक प्रबेस कियो सुमिरि प्रभु मैथिली।जय कोसलेस महेस बंदित चरन रति अति निर्मली।।प्रतिबिंब अरु लौकिक कलंक प्रचंड पावक महुँ जरे।प्रभु चरित काहुँ न लखे नभ सुर सिद्ध मुनि देखहिं खरे।।1।।धरि रूप पावक पानि गहि श्री सत्य श्रुति जग बिदित जो।जिमि छीरसागर इंदिरा रामहि समर्पी आनि सो।।सो राम बाम बिभाग राजति रुचिर अति सोभा भली।नव नील नीरज निकट मानहुँ कनक पंकज की कली।।2।। Translation:With Her thoughts fixed on the Lord the Princess of Mithilå entered the flames as though they were cool like sandal-paste crying “Glory to the Lord of Kosala whose feet are adored by the great Lord Shiva with the purest devotion !” Both Her shadow-form as well as the social stigma (occasioned by Her forced residence at Råvanas) were consumed in the blazing fire; but no one could know the secret of the Lord's doings. Even the gods Siddhas and sages stood gazing in the air. Fire assumed a bodily form and taking by the hand the real Sri(Sita) celebrated alike in the Vedas and the world escorted and presented Her to lord Råma even as the Ocean of milk presented Goddess Indirå (Lakshmi) to Lord Vishnu. Standing on the left side of lord Råma She shone resplendent in Her exquisite beauty like the bud of a gold lily beside a fresh blue lotus.Read this to know about Valmiki Ramayana and Ramcharitamanas difference Rishabh Pandey's answer to Why did Tulsidas write Ramcharitmanas much different from Valmiki Ramayana?,Rishabh Pandey,https://www.quora.com/profile/Rishabh-Pandey-204

As for Romans — and Greeks … and most anyone else in the world who didn’t live in an alluvial flatland flanked by deserts — they built their chief urban temples on the city citadel for 2 pretty obvious reasons: (1) higher means closer to the gods/heavens — pity the poor Egyptians and Chaldeans who had to build their own holy mountains from scratch! — and (2) it’s the safest place if the city is attacked by an enemy. But that’s still in the middle of their cities. In fact the temple-palace-citadel tended to come first and city then grew up around it. So I don’t know what holy places you’re referring to. If there were any in hard to reach places it’s either because of some historical or legendary event with religious significance that happened there or because there was something truly wonderous to see there and they attributed religious significance to that.,Jack Wallace,https://www.quora.com/profile/Jack-Wallace-11

Tamils or the Southerners are the ancient people of the Peninsular India. Sanskrit was existing in Tamilnadu along with Tamil much before any other Indian language had any connection with it. Tamils were the teachers of this created language from Tamil. It was an unwise assumption or hearsay of foreigners who thought that they know Indian history better which they know only not more than 400 years. The author of Mahabharata Vyasa was a Tamil. Connecting him with mythology is a bundle of imaginations. The claims of mythology with Lord shiv and Mahabharata are all sheer imagination. Mahabharata was written only 700 years ago There is no scientific proof of evidence to say that Mahabharata was above 10000 years old. The Hinduism is the off shoot of the way of life that existed here than from Indus Valley. There was nothing to prove that real North Indians or others who migrated to the northern part of India had knowledge of Hinduism before Southern Indians. The temples are the standing proof that they belong to ancient Tamils. It is a wonder that they survived all the destructive wars and natural disasters. Yet Tamils are termed as rustic for they remained absolutely nonviolent since ages. The influence of Lord Buddha  Lord Mahaveer and Saint Thiruvalluvar refined them further. And lastly Swamy Vivekananda and Maha Kavi Bharathi. The wonderful list of literary greats of Tamil goes on and on. The list of great nationalists scientists and reformers is unbelievably long too. These are the divine gift of this spiritual land called Tamilnadu. It could not have been possible without the great temples which guided the people in peaceful path. The temples are not mere stones they reflect the people who created them. All Indians must visit Tamilnadu. Learn Tamil to experience the true ancient Indian culture religion or way of life though it is declining with globalization and materialism being dumped from other parts of this vast world. The temples speak for the history of India and beyond. Temples in Southern India proves that the people who lived here were one of the greatest civilizations of the world and the brothers and sisters living in northern part of India should also be proud of it instead of trying to glorify Sanskrit for it is also coexisted and promoted by ancient Tamils.,Padmanabhan Venkatesan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Padmanabhan-Venkatesan-1

Truly it’s a mystical place.(Self captured image)Water is so blue and transparent you can see at least 30ft from your naked eyes. Why blue? There are scientific reasons which explain the indigo blue colour. This colour is very surprising and rarely found and it looks extremely attractive in combination with the rocks present around. Link to the Sea There is a famous incident of 2004 when Mumbai was hit with a Tsunami and the water level of this Kund rose by 50ft. There are no photographs or any other proofs but we do have a witness Yes you head it right! My grandfather was there his native place is nearby and he went to see the rise in water. It’s very difficult to believe being a science student but life is full of wonders. More we understand we get to know how little we know. Unknown depth It’s wrong to say that the depth is unmeasurable but nobody till date has got success to find the depth including Discovery Channel. In the Journal of Geological Society of India it’s mentioned that “It widens downward to 45 m into a sub-surface water channel with steep/vertical walls. Several groundwater streams make a sort of network.” People are misinterpreting this information with 45 m as depth. However it is clearly mentioned that “Its depth beneath the water surface could not be measured.” So the sub-surface level is at 45 m which then has a network of tunnels due to which technologies like SONAR and submarine fails to find the depth and the water never drought out. Clean water Usually water stored in some place like ponds lakes becomes dirty and contaminated. Lots of people bath in this water daily and even wash their clothes but the water remains as clean as whistle. Mythology There are two mythologies about this as follows:In Mahabharata to quench the thirst of Draupadi Bhim used his weapon to get the water out of the Earth and Arjun used his arrow to make the way to it.I believe this could be true because geologists have found the fossils of elephants in that place which dates to the same time as Mahabharata. Also the area nearby always has a scarcity of water so it completely makes sense to dig and get the water.Lord Vishnu came out of this Kund. I haven’t read much about this and can’t relate as well.Caves There are a lot of caves present there which nobody could explore much due to the presence of bats and snakes. I tried to summarize my research on it. Thanks for reading! P.S: If you want to visit this place do ping me. I can give you more details.,Chirayu Asati,https://www.quora.com/profile/Chirayu-Asati

RelatedWhat is the Mookambika Temple famous for?,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-Mookambika-Temple-famous-for,,The Kolluru Mookambika Temple was named after “Kola Maharishi” who did penance to the Hindu Trinity of Brahma Vishnu and Shiva and there is a “Swayambhu” or Self manifested Lingam of Lord Shiva which has a golden line cutting it into half in which the left half represents Tridevis and the right half represents Trimurtis. Along with this a four-handed panchaloha idol of Goddess Mookambika is also installed. It is believed that Adi Shankaracharya had a vision of Sri Mookambika Devi and installed the deity here. One day Devi appeared before Adi Shankaracharya asking for his wish. He revealed his wish to install the Devi idol in a place in Kerala to worship. Devi agreed but put forward a condition that she will follow Shankara and he should not look back till he reaches his destination. But to test Shankara Devi deliberately stopped the noise of her anklets when they reached Kollur whereupon Shankara turned and looked back because of doubt. Devi then asked Shankara to install her vigraha at that very location at Kollur. The original temple where Shankara meditated and Devi appeared before him is at Kodachadri peak (1343 mt) which is at a distance of about 21 kms from Kollur also visible as a large mountain peak from Kollur Shri Mookambika Devi Temple.

I suspect the real number of temples is larger and that a lot of small village and neighborhood temples without officially organized registered management did not get counted. I’m sure they didn’t miss any big temples like this:But did they really track down all the little remote rural temples like this?So the most accurate answer that can be given is more than two million. I would not be surprised if the real number is three or four million. Given this it feels rather unfair to pick a favorite. I have probably visited more than a hundred temples in India but less than three hundred. That feels like a lot but it’s nothing compared to the millions of temples out there many of which I’m sure are wonderful and probably surpassing any I’ve seen.

The four wells were surrounding a single well. The four wells were overflowing with very sweet water as if they were not able to hold water and surprisingly the well in the middle of these four overflowing wells was completely empty. Bhima was also puzzled at this sight. Nakula was returning to the place after picking up the arrow. He stopped at a place where a cow was about to give birth. After giving birth the cow started licking the calf but continued to lick it even after the calf was clean. With great difficulty people were able to separate them and by that time the calf was injured badly. Nakula was puzzled by the behaviour of such a calm animal. Sahadeva picked arrow which fell near a mountain and saw a big boulder falling. The boulder was crushing the rocks and big trees on its way down but the same boulder was stopped by a small plant. Sahadeva was also amazed at this sight. All the Pandavas asked the meaning of these incidents. Krishna smiled and started explaining... ""In Kaliyuga the priests will have very sweet voice and will also have great knowledge but they will exploit devotees the same way cuckoo was doing with rabbit. In Kaliyuga poor will live among rich those rich will have enormous amount of wealth which will actually overflow but they will not offer a single penny to the poor same as the four wells didn't have a single drop of water for the empty well. In Kaliyuga parents will love their children so much that their love will actually spoil them and will destroy their lives similar to the love shown by cow to her newborn calf. In Kaliyuga people will fall in terms of character like the boulder from the mountain and they will not be stopped by anyone at the end only the name of God will be able to hold them from doom like the little plant held the boulder from further fall."" ~ Uddhava Gita Srimad Bhaagawatam.",Aditya Mestry,https://www.quora.com/profile/Aditya-Mestry-2

Hence he explored further and achieved complete liberation from suffering through a combination of calm abiding and insight (shamatha and vipassana). And this is the path he taught. It was a personal exploration for him. And he urged his followers not to believe in him blindly but to explore the truth for themselves. Over the last 2500 years many have been exploring this path themselves. I have been doing it for a very short time. However what I and others have discovered is that the path the Buddha taught actually works. And while I may have been critical of other paths before I practiced Buddhism (I was a staunch atheist) I now have the utmost respect for all paths. As I can see a place for all of them. I’m sure the Buddha had a similar idea which is why his teachings are not militant or overtly critical. Yes there are debates but those debates are there for the seeker to reach the truth. There are also things that were outright harmful (like sacrifices) which he pointed out in a straight forward way. And that was probably the main problem he had with the practices of his time.

For many Hindus temples are places of refuge during difficult times where we can go to find solace hope inspiration and guidance in the presence of our Gods helping us overcome challenges in our lives. Other times we may visit temples just to be with our Gods for no purpose other than the joy of devotion.There are literally millions of temples all over India each with its own unique history its story its spiritual specialties and its annual celebrations and customs. As such temples are key storehouses of Indian culture tradition arts values and way of life. Many aspects of Hindu culture civilization community and identity are carried on mainly in temples and it is temples that ensure their survival.Many temples are some of the most beautiful buildings in India.Lots of temples are peaceful places of calm and serenity:Others are busy places of festive communal devotion.Many are ancient works of amazing architecture; dozens are UNESCO World Heritage sites.A very practical point of importance is that most temples in India (certainly almost all big temples) give free food to visitors. In a country with a high poverty rate temples are a very literal lifeline for many Indians.Another important way in which temples give practical help to poor people in India is providing community services like weddings and other cultural ceremonies more cheaply than other venues.Of course many temples are also tourist attractions which is important to local economies.,Devala Rees,https://www.quora.com/profile/Devala-Rees

Upon seeing them Duryodhana tells them that he wants to gift the Hastinapur Kingdom and Crown to Pandavas. Yudhistir rejects this saying Hastinapur is not Duryodhan’s to gift. He instead offers Duryodhana to pick one of the Pandavas for a one-on-one fight with the weapon of his choice. It is a known fact that Duryodhana is very good with mace and would have easily defeated Yudhistir Arjuna Nakula and Sahadeva. But he prefers to fight his arch-nemesis Bheema who is the one who can match him in a duel with Mace.Despite Bhima's physical advantage Duryodhana had the better technique due to his devotion to his craft (This is why Balarama likes Duryodhana more than Bheema who taught both of them the craft of Mace fighting). After a long and brutal battle between the two disciples of Balarama Duryodhana begins to exhaust Bhima and nearly makes Bhima faint.Krishna who had been observing the duel signals to Bheema repeatedly clapping his own thigh. This is a clear violation of the mace fighting but Bheema who is now reminded of the oath he had taken after the game of dice to crush Duryodhana’s thighs starts attacking Duryodhana’s thighs mortally injuring him.Duryodhana bemoans that he was slain by unfair means given that it was illegal to attack below the waist. He curses Krishna for his deceitful tricks and Pandavas for openly flouting the rules of war.Balarama is enraged after knowing that Bheema broke the rules of Mace fight to kill and raises his weapon in attack. Lord Krishna consoles Balarama by reminding him of Duryodhana's evil deeds. Relenting but fuming Balarama curses Bheema to be known in the world as a crooked warrior and blesses Duryodhana with glory naming Duryodhana his greatest pupil.Source: Duryodhana #duryodhana - DeviantArt Google Images,Suryateja Rokkam,https://www.quora.com/profile/Suryateja-Rokkam-1

RelatedDid Buddha believe in God?,https://www.quora.com/Did-Buddha-believe-in-God?no_redirect=1,,** Please note that the words I have used are not 100% matching to the exact words Lord Buddha has mentioned. But I will try to give the idea. In Buddhism there is no such thing called ‘believing in god’. Lord Buddha has mentioned that there are several worlds around us.Brahma - This is the highest level where a creature can be born once dead. This level is above the level where gods live.World of gods - This is where the gods we are talking about lives in. There are gods who follow/believes in Buddism and gods who don’t follow Buddhism. We cannot see these worlds through our 5 senses. If we want to see these worlds we have to develop our mind.World of Humans - This is where we live in.World of animals - This is the world where cats dogs and all kinds of animals live. Yes we can see this world.Hell - This is the lowest and the most dangerous place to be born in. This is where we will be punished for our bad deeds.There are several other worlds in between which I don’t know how to tell in English. However the idea is there are more worlds than what we see. World of gods are just one of them. Gods can see the human world. They may be watching us all the time. Since we cannot see them through our 5 senses we have no proof for the moment. What Lord Buddha said was that even a god can be born in any of those worlds once dead (depending on the last thought we will have when we die). Also any creature from any other world can be born in the world of gods depending on their last thought. Lord Buddha could see all these worlds could communicate with gods. What Lord Buddha told to the world through Buddhism was explaining how this process happen. How a god can be an animal in the other life or how a person can be a god in the other life. Therefore Lord Buddha did not believe in gods instead Lord Buddha saw all the worlds and saw the “truth” in the world. That is why Lord Buddha mentioned that the comfort you can get by being a god is temporary. If you want to achieve eternal comfort you need to achieve nirvana which will stop anyone from being born again in any of those worlds.,Imesha Sudasingha,https://www.quora.com/profile/Imesha-Sudasingha

Your basic nature reflects your inclination towards a particular God your Ishta Devtha! The Chosen One! We all have preferences. We all make choices. It reflects in our thoughts words and actions. Everyone is ruled by the great three types of characters namely Satvic Rajasic and Tamasic. An ordinary guy like me is ruled by all the three gunas. But my basic character is satvic. I value compassion over anything else in life. Which God fits this role the most? Shiva! He is grace personified! You can take liberty with Him! He is described as the one who is easily pleased! He grants boons without a second thought fully aware that He will get into trouble granting them! But Narayan is not that easily pleased! He weighs the pros and cons! Because He is the protector the sustainer! He can't afford to be carefree! His role must be weighing down on Him! Whew! He protects the Universe like a king who protects his country his subjects! Naturally He is opulence personified. Ma Lakshmi the Godess of wealth is His consort! Lavish kingly life yet answerable to the subjects! So Narayan is very strict in granting boons! Tough to please Him. Do you see in you any similarities with Narayan? But ultimately there's no difference between Shiva and Narayan! They are the different manifestations of Brahman!

Brahmavadini literally means ‘the woman who speaks about Brahman’.Brahmavadini or ""an expounder of the Veda"" are those women who composed any hymns of the Vedas. The prominent among them were Lopamudra Vishwawara Sikta Ghosha and Maitreyi. Maitreyi (the wife of Yajnavalkya) is accredited with about ten hymns in Rig Veda. Two suktas (hymns) of the tenth Mandala (book) of Rigveda 39 and 40 each containing 14 verses have been attributed to Ghosha. Lopamudra was the wife of the sage Agastya. A hymn in the Rigveda is attributed to her.Brahmavadini - WikipediaSwami Vivekananda also talks about women’s education in the Vedic era.The next idea of the Aryans is the freedom of women. It is in the Aryan literature that we find women in ancient times taking the same share as men and in no other literature of the world. In the tenth chapter(of Rig Veda) comes a peculiar hymn — for the sage is a woman — and it is dedicated to the one God who is at the background of all these gods. All the previous hymns are spoken in the third person as if someone were addressing the deities. But this hymn takes a departure: God [as the Devi] is speaking for herself. The pronoun used is ""I"". ""I am the Empress of the Universe the Fulfiller of all prayers."" (Vide “Devi Sukta” Rig-Veda 10.125) This is the first glimpse of women's work in the Vedas. As we go on we find them taking a greater share — even officiating as priests. There is not one passage throughout the whole mass of literature of the Vedas which can be construed even indirectly as signifying that woman could never be a priest. In fact there are many examples of women officiating as priests. Then we come to the last portion of these Vedas — which is really the religion of India — the concentrated wisdom of which has not been surpassed even in this century. There too we find women preeminent. A large portion of these books are words which have proceeded from the mouths of women. It is there — recorded with their names and teachings. There is that beautiful story of the great sage Yâjnavalkya the one who visited the kingdom of the great king Janaka. And there in that assembly of the learned people came to ask him questions. One man asked him ""How am I to perform this sacrifice?"" Another asked him ""How am I to perform the other sacrifice?"" And after he had answered them there arose a woman who said ""These are childish questions. Now have a care: I take these two arrows my two questions. Answer them if you can and we will then call you a sage. The first is: What is the soul? The second is: What is God?"" ( Brihadâranyaka Upanishad 3.8.1.-12.) Thus arose in India the great questions about the soul and God and these came from the mouth of a woman.

RelatedWhich are the things that come under Sattvik Rajsik and Tamsik according to the Bhagavad Gita?,https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-things-that-come-under-Sattvik-Rajsik-and-Tamsik-according-to-the-Bhagavad-Gita,,Everything material in the universe comes under Sattvik Rajasik and Tamasik. These three modes make up prakriti which is the sum total of everything material. When these three modes are in perfect equilibrium nothing happens there is no activity. Then at the beginning of creation the desires of the living entity with the will of Maha-Visnu and the influence of time agitate the three modes and the entire creation unfolds from the subtle to the gross. There is always competition between the three modes. It can be visualized like a pie chart with shifting divisions. As the influence of one increases the other two decrease and then there’s a change and a smaller section increases and becomes bigger than the other two. In this way one or other is always trying to dominate. The effects of each of the modes is summarized by Krishna in one line.O son of Bharata the mode of goodness conditions one to happiness; passion conditions one to fruitive action; and ignorance covering one's knowledge binds one to madness. Bg 14.9This is a summary of the three previous verses. If you want more details then they are below.O sinless one the mode of goodness being purer than the others is illuminating and it frees one from all sinful reactions. Those situated in that mode become conditioned by a sense of happiness and knowledge. PURPORT The living entities conditioned by material nature are of various types. One is happy another is very active and another is helpless. All these types of psychological manifestations are causes of the entities' conditioned status in nature. How they are differently conditioned is explained in this section of Bhagavad-gita. The mode of goodness is first considered. The effect of developing the mode of goodness in the material world is that one becomes wiser than those otherwise conditioned. A man in the mode of goodness is not so much affected by material miseries and he has a sense of advancement in material knowledge. The representative type is the brahmana who is supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness. This sense of happiness is due to understanding that in the mode of goodness one is more or less free from sinful reactions. Actually in the Vedic literature it is said that the mode of goodness means greater knowledge and a greater sense of happiness. The difficulty here is that when a living entity is situated in the mode of goodness he becomes conditioned to feel that he is advanced in knowledge and is better than others. In this way he becomes conditioned. The best examples are the scientist and the philosopher. Each is very proud of his knowledge and because they generally improve their living conditions they feel a sort of material happiness. This sense of advanced happiness in conditioned life makes them bound by the mode of goodness of material nature. As such they are attracted toward working in the mode of goodness and as long as they have an attraction for working in that way they have to take some type of body in the modes of nature. Thus there is no likelihood of liberation or of being transferred to the spiritual world. Repeatedly one may become a philosopher a scientist or a poet and repeatedly become entangled in the same disadvantages of birth and death. But due to the illusion of the material energy one thinks that that sort of life is pleasant. Bg 14.6 The mode of passion is born of unlimited desires and longings O son of Kunti and because of this the embodied living entity is bound to material fruitive actions. PURPORT The mode of passion is characterized by the attraction between man and woman. Woman has attraction for man and man has attraction for woman. This is called the mode of passion. And when the mode of passion is increased one develops the hankering for material enjoyment. He wants to enjoy sense gratification. For sense gratification a man in the mode of passion wants some honor in society or in the nation and he wants to have a happy family with nice children wife and house. These are the products of the mode of passion. As long as one is hankering after these things he has to work very hard. Therefore it is clearly stated here that he becomes associated with the fruits of his activities and thus becomes bound by such activities. In order to please his wife children and society and to keep up his prestige one has to work. Therefore the whole material world is more or less in the mode of passion. Modern civilization is considered to be advanced in the standard of the mode of passion. Formerly the advanced condition was considered to be in the mode of goodness. If there is no liberation for those in the mode of goodness what to speak of those who are entangled in the mode of passion? Bg 14.7 O son of Bharata know that the mode of darkness born of ignorance is the delusion of all embodied living entities. The results of this mode are madness indolence and sleep which bind the conditioned soul. PURPORT In this verse the specific application of the word tu is very significant. This means that the mode of ignorance is a very peculiar qualification of the embodied soul. The mode of ignorance is just the opposite of the mode of goodness. In the mode of goodness by development of knowledge one can understand what is what but the mode of ignorance is just the opposite. Everyone under the spell of the mode of ignorance becomes mad and a madman cannot understand what is what. Instead of making advancement one becomes degraded. The definition of the mode of ignorance is stated in the Vedic literature. Vastu-yathatmya-jnanavarakam viparyaya-jnana-janakam tamah: under the spell of ignorance one cannot understand a thing as it is. For example everyone can see that his grandfather has died and therefore he will also die; man is mortal. The children that he conceives will also die. So death is sure. Still people are madly accumulating money and working very hard all day and night not caring for the eternal spirit. This is madness. In their madness they are very reluctant to make advancement in spiritual understanding. Such people are very lazy. When they are invited to associate for spiritual understanding they are not much interested. They are not even active like the man who is controlled by the mode of passion. Thus another symptom of one embedded in the mode of ignorance is that he sleeps more than is required. Six hours of sleep is sufficient but a man in the mode of ignorance sleeps at least ten or twelve hours a day. Such a man appears to be always dejected and is addicted to intoxicants and sleeping. These are the symptoms of a person conditioned by the mode of ignorance. Bg 14.8Because the three modes are the sum and substance of the material world they are a huge topic. Everyone intuitively has a little idea of them but only a few people have a detailed understanding and I doubt anyone unfamiliar with Vedic knowledge has a good grasp. In chapter 18 there are more verses that deal with a variety of topics under goodness passion and ignorance. I will list just the translations.Bg 18.19 - According to the three different modes of material nature there are three kinds of knowledge action and performer of action. Now hear of them from Me. Bg 18.20 - That knowledge by which one undivided spiritual nature is seen in all living entities though they are divided into innumerable forms you should understand to be in the mode of goodness. Bg 18.21 - That knowledge by which one sees that in every different body there is a different type of living entity you should understand to be in the mode of passion. Bg 18.22 - And that knowledge by which one is attached to one kind of work as the all in all without knowledge of the truth and which is very meager is said to be in the mode of darkness. Bg 18.23 - That action which is regulated and which is performed without attachment without love or hatred and without desire for fruitive results is said to be in the mode of goodness. Bg 18.24 - But action performed with great effort by one seeking to gratify his desires and enacted from a sense of false ego is called action in the mode of passion. Bg 18.25 - That action performed in illusion in disregard of scriptural injunctions and without concern for future bondage or for violence or distress caused to others is said to be in the mode of ignorance. Bg 18.26 - One who performs his duty without association with the modes of material nature without false ego with great determination and enthusiasm and without wavering in success or failure is said to be a worker in the mode of goodness. Bg 18.27 - The worker who is attached to work and the fruits of work desiring to enjoy those fruits and who is greedy always envious impure and moved by joy and sorrow is said to be in the mode of passion. Bg 18.28 - The worker who is always engaged in work against the injunctions of the scripture who is materialistic obstinate cheating and expert in insulting others and who is lazy always morose and procrastinating is said to be a worker in the mode of ignorance18.29 - O winner of wealth now please listen as I tell you in detail of the different kinds of understanding and determination according to the three modes of material nature. Bg 18.30 - O son of Prtha that understanding by which one knows what ought to be done and what ought not to be done what is to be feared and what is not to be feared what is binding and what is liberating is in the mode of goodness. Bg 18.31 - O son of Prtha that understanding which cannot distinguish between religion and irreligion between action that should be done and action that should not be done is in the mode of passion. Bg 18.32 - That understanding which considers irreligion to be religion and religion to be irreligion under the spell of illusion and darkness and strives always in the wrong direction O Partha is in the mode of ignorance. Bg 18.33 - O son of Prtha that determination which is unbreakable which is sustained with steadfastness by yoga practice and which thus controls the activities of the mind life and senses is determination in the mode of goodness. Bg 18.34 - But that determination by which one holds fast to fruitive results in religion economic development and sense gratification is of the nature of passion O Arjuna. Bg 18.35 - And that determination which cannot go beyond dreaming fearfulness lamentation moroseness and illusion-such unintelligent determination O son of Prtha is in the mode of darkness.Bg 18.36 - O best of the Bharatas now please hear from Me about the three kinds of happiness by which the conditioned soul enjoys and by which he sometimes comes to the end of all distress. Bg 18.37 - That which in the beginning may be just like poison but at the end is just like nectar and which awakens one to self-realization is said to be happiness in the mode of goodness. Bg 18.38 - That happiness which is derived from contact of the senses with their objects and which appears like nectar at first but poison at the end is said to be of the nature of passion. Bg 18.39 - And that happiness which is blind to self-realization which is delusion from beginning to end and which arises from sleep laziness and illusion is said to be of the nature of ignorance. Bg 18.40 - There is no being existing either here or among the demigods in the higher planetary systems which is freed from these three modes born of material nature.There are more details in chapter 14 including the circumstances around one’s death because everything material can be understood by the analysis of these three modes.When one dies in the mode of goodness he attains to the pure higher planets of the great sages. Bg 14.15 - When one dies in the mode of passion he takes birth among those engaged in fruitive activities; and when one dies in the mode of ignorance he takes birth in the animal kingdom. From the mode of goodness real knowledge develops; from the mode of passion greed develops; and from the mode of ignorance develop foolishness madness and illusion. Bg 14.17Once a clear picture of the modes of nature has formed a person can navigate through life avoiding the hidden reefs and sandbars that lie invisibly beneath the surface of daily activities.,Murari Das,https://www.quora.com/profile/Murari-Das-1

First of all what happens with people who hurt me is not in my control. I am neither their conscience keeper nor their moral compass and its not my job to ensure they get punished for being assholes. People play the roles they want to play and if they choose to play an asshole that's about it. I cannot do anything about it but what is in my control is how I choose to let or not let their dumbfuckery define my life. When you bear grudges against people who hurt you you allow them to take up space in your life. The moment you disassociate from them saying that “ This person is toxic for me and I need to stand up for myself now I need to protect myself now"" you remove them out of your picture. The moment you do that its over. Now whether they die or live or get punished or instead flourish is none of your business because its not your picture. Yes there is a feeling of vindication when you see someone who hurt you suffer and pay for their actions  directly or indirectly I will not deny that. But that joy never lasts long term. Because Karma is not about them. Karma is about you and your picture. Karma is going through absolute shit hell and coming back right up like a queen. I am of course not talking about legal cases.

Sometimes the Mother knows more than the child. Let your heart open to Her and trust Her. She is not an ATM that you collect from She is your Mother. Love Her and trust Her. Bring Her all these angsts but bring them with your heart. Talk to Her. Relax She even knows what i write here and She is with you. Always.,Stevie Moon,https://www.quora.com/profile/Stevie-Moon

Its recital is designed in such a manner one starts with Bala Kandam (chapters of birth) on Day 1 and ends on 31st day of the month by reciting the last line of Uttara Kandam (the later chapters) with a daily recital of a part of it for around 30 to 60 minutes per day.The holy Adhyathma Ramayanam a common spiritual book found in most of the hindu homes in Kerala. Its one of the most celebrated classics of Malayalam literature. Its recited by some member of the family mostly elders in morning hours after lighting the Nilavilakku (the sacred lamp). All temples also have similar process while almost of the radio stations and television channels do dedicate one hour slots in mornings for Ramayanam recitals. Its a much celebrated ritual across Kerala along with other traditions associated with this month. Why so? Well the primary reason is Nature Kerala records highest rainfall during the months of June-July. The monsoons officially start in Kerala by last week of May and takes its fiery form by third week of June. In July the intensity of rain may reduce but essentially it will be continously raining. The extreme rains in month of June will start flooding most of the rivers. This means by July most of the rivers will be flooded. People can’t move out or have an active social life in this period. Equally its a time when waterborne diseases spreads around like epidemic. Its common to have fever and other illness in this period. And in olden days its a time of food scarcity due to lower production of food in this period. So generally this month is often called as Panja Masam (Month of Miseries) in olden days. And as its a miserable month people resort for spiritual solace by reading Ramayana.When it rains terribly and one gets confined to 4 walls of home with all miseries naturally there is no other better work than Ramayana to give a spiritual comfort.  Why Adhyathma Ramayanam?Recital video of first chapter of Adhyathma Ramayanam Adhyathma Ramayanam was the first major literary work of 16th century to written in simple Malayalam by celebrated Malayalam poet- Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunchaththu_Ezhuthachan ]. Its the Malayalam translated version of celebrated medieval era Sanskrit text on same name- Adhyathma Ramayana [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhyatma_Ramayana ]. Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan is often called as Malayala Bhashapitavu (Father of Malayalam Language) for his contribution in converting Malayalam script to Gantha script instead of then the common Vattaezhuthu script. And it was this epic that set new standard in Malayalam literature by adopting a simple Malayalam which commoners can understand instead of highly classical Manipravalam [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipravalam ] texts which were used for literary works before it. Adhyathama Ramayanam was composed in Killipattu [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilippattu ] style (Parrot Song) which had its own charms in narration as the lyrics were focused more on sound effect of the poems which soothes one’s mind while listening instead of traditional kind of monotonous poem recitals. There is one more major reason why Adhyathama Ramayanam has over other spiritual texts. While its in simple malayalam which is easy to understand it also has several contexts that differ from original Valmiki Ramayana. Valmiki Ramayana focused itself as a story of a Human prince called Rama and the ordeals he faced while keeping himself as the most ideal Human being. Adhayathama Ramayanam changed the concept of Rama more as an incarnation of Lord Vishnu with a divine halo instead of a human being. Infact he is much like how Krishna is depicted in Mahabharatha (with a divinity). So unlike original Adayathama Ramayana has several contexts or situations where Rama preaches spiritual values and philosophies to Lakshmana and Hanuman. In this work Rama is a spiritual teacher and there is a portion called RAMA GITA [ http://www.mantraonnet.com/ram-gita.html ] (the song of Rama) much similar to Bhagavat Gita concept in Mahabharat. Rama gita is a portion where Rama explains the spiritual context of identity of Lord Vishnu and the secret of life to Lakshmana. These concepts are essentially part of original Sanskrit Adhayathama Ramayana as well as in the Awadhi work- Ramacharitamanasa of Tulsidas but Ezhuthachan simplified the highly complex Rama gita essence in simple concepts which ordinary people can related in day to day life. This marked difference makes Adhyathama Ramayanam a much easier and simpler spiritual text for one to find spiritual solace in times of grief and misery. As Rama himself has faced all miseries of life it simply helps commoners to co-relate.  Traditionally Ramayana Parayanam (Recital of Ramayanam) was mostly an upper class trait. Its used to a mandatory rite among upper caste Hindu families to read Ramayana during this month as well as in times of distress (Ramayana is often read in times of mourning when the body of deceased is brought to home for final rites and prayers). One must understand its not read out of any special devotion to Lord Rama as Rama isn’t a popular god for Hindus of Kerala. However Adhyathama Ramayanam as a...,Arun Mohan (അരുൺ മോഹൻ),https://www.quora.com/profile/Arun-Mohan-%E0%B4%85%E0%B4%B0%E0%B5%81%E0%B5%BA-%E0%B4%AE%E0%B5%8B%E0%B4%B9%E0%B5%BB

Arjuna was also not concerned about him that much although he had vowed to kill him. It was Bhima and Karna who had animosity and it was Yudhisthir who respected or say valued him as a threat. So in reality the pandavas who thought about karna were Bhima and yudhisthir not Arjuna. In Mb also it were Krishna Bhima and yudhi who were always pushing Arjuna to kill Karna or fight him. Arjuna had anger as well as respect towards opposite camp but he was fighting the war for victory and justice more than such emotions. Even after death of Karna Pandavas did feal bad but for a while. Karna had strained relations so bad that even after death other four were not that much annoyed as people believe. It was only Yudhi who was crying and lamenting. And there also Arjuna said it is karma and we have to live with it and do our duty. More of less it seems the whole respect and hate game was within yudhi Bhima and karna then the much hyped rivalry.

It is called NAVAKELEVAR i.e new bod. This period is called 'Adhimasa' or 'Malamasa'. A year with an extra ( Adhika masa) Ashadha Masa/month as per Hindu calendar is considered highly auspicious for conducting the ceremony. The four deities undergo the process of Nabakalebara in the year in which falls the Adhimasa. Body preparation is a wonderful journey when the Deities are made from a special type of Neem (called as MAHANIMVA/MAHANEEM) wood known as Daru Bramha. Preparations for the ceremony start in the month of Chaitra. The most recent ceremony was done in the year 2015 and the one before that was in 1996.when it starts with search for the tree from which idol can be made  Jirna Bera Parityaga :literally meaning leaving the old deity and consecration of new one. As a person puts on new garments giving up old ones the soul similarly accepts new material bodies giving up the old and useless ones. According to different secret protocols followed from time immemorial in the temple the provision is there for changing of the deities. The deities are made up of neem tree basicallyalong with musk sandalwood and many other rare combinations. Different ""agama shashtra"" followed in other parts of India for Vishnu worship such as Vaikhanasa also prescribe change of deities made up of wood under specific astrological combination. It is to be noted that the deities made of stone or metal need not be changed unless damaged but the wooden deities are to be changed within specific gap of years and the supreme power must be installed from the old one to the new one by secret rituals. No ordinary Neem tree can be used to make the deities . For the identifiacation of the Darus some conditions and signs are taken into account. The ""daru"" (woodlog) of Sudarshan should have three branches.The skin (bark) of the Neem tree should be reddish.The tree should have sign of Chakra(Wheel) with a small depression in the middle. The ""daru"" of Balabhadra should have seven branches.The skin of the tree should be of light brown or white. It should have a sign of plough and pestle on it.Nearby the tree should be a heritage site and also a graveyard. The  ""daru"" of Subhadra should have five branches.The bark of the tree should be yellowish.The should be sign of Lotus flower on the tree. The ""daru"" of Jagannath should have four main branches.The bark of the tree should be dark in color. The tree should have sign of Shankha (conch shell) and ""chakra"" on it.There should be a cremation ground nearby the tree. The should be an anthill near the tree and a snake hole at the roots of the tree. The tree should be situated near a river or pond or a crossing of the three-ways or else to be surrounded by three mountains.There should not be nests of birds on the tree and no bird have ever perched over the tree.The tree should be surrounded by other trees preferably VarunaSahadaBelva.There should a temple of Lord Shiva in the neighborhood of the tree.The should be some heritage site nearby and the tree should be free from Nirmulilata (parasitic plants like cuscuta or dodder) and creepers. After the sacred trees are located they are cut down after appropriate ritual observance. The logs are then transported by small carts pulled by devotees all the way till the temple at Puri. Starting at an auspicious hour with the fullest of secrecy the logs are carved into deities within the Temple premises. On the midnight of Adhika Ashadha krishna Chaturdashi the Tattva Padartha is transferred from the old deity to the new deities . Bramha or Tattva or soul of Lord is a super natural thing. After this the new deities are worshiped and the old deities buried in the sand inside temple premises (Koili Vaikuntha) Elaborate rituals numerous myths and several celestial incidents are attached to this auspicious affair. The exact procedure of the transformation of images have been mentioned in the Sanskrit manuscripts written on palm leaves which are kept in the temple. Only the three head priests of the temple have the sole responsibility of reading and interpreting them. Apart from the regulation associated with the selection of tree there are various rituals associated for locating the same and bringing it to the temple premises. These are mentioned in details below: Rituals associated with the Nava Kalevara The countdown to the Naba Kalebara of Lord Jagannath starts with the formation of the search party that would go out to locate the “Holy Tree”.The search party consists of1 member of the Pati Mahapatra family20 Dayitapatis1 Lenka9 Maharanas16 Brahmanas3 Deulakaranas30 police officers2 inspectors of policeThe function begins after the Big Midday Offering to Lord Jagannath. The blessings of the Lord is sought.A twelve-foot garland called Dhanva Mala made specially for this day is offered to the lord and His siblings. After worshipping the Lord the garland is given to the Pati Mahapatra family who is meant to lead the procession. He would from then on carry the huge garland until the sacred tree is located. Upon spotting the tree the Garland is placed on top of a coconut and offered to the Tree. Apart from the garland the robes of Lord are given to the descendants of Bitarachha Mahapatra family Dayitapaties and the Pati Mahapatra who would tie it as a turban on their head while going on the procession. Both the garland and the clothes are significant in the sense that it is indicative of the Lord himself traveling with the team. Patta clothes used by the Lord are also given to the Lenka family representative and the nine Maharanas who accompany the group. They are the actual carpenters who build the new chariots every year and who will make the new Jagannath deities as well. Once the Mekap family members touch the forehead of each members of the procession with the Lord’s sandal the procession officially takes off. Their first halt would be the palace of the King of Puri where they are required to seek his permission to continue on the holy mission. After staying here for two days and doing meditations and prayers the team starts out for Kakatpur a village 50 miles of Puri to the famous temple of Maa Mangala. After reaching the village they take rest for several days while the oldest. Dayitapati sleeps inside the temple. He must have a dream during this stay in which goddess Mangala tells him the exact location where the trees can be found. The tree for each of the four deities will be in a different place. This may take as long as 15 days to one month.During this entire period the group would eat the prasada of goddess Mangala. But sometimes provision is made for MAHAPRASAD to be brought from Puri. Once the tree is located that fulfills all the required conditions a yagna is performed in front of it. Now the team moves to a temporary thatched hut nearby and stays in it till the trees are felled. The cutting of the tree would commence at an auspicious time and with prescribed rituals. The Pati Mahapatra first touches the tree with a golden axe followed by the Dayitapati who touches it with a silver axe. Lastly the head wood carver of the Maharana family would touch it with an iron axe. During the tree cutting the 108 names of God are chanted. It is said that even a leaf of the tree must not be eaten as it is considered a contamination.  Once the tree is fallenonly a few parts from the tree are selected for idol formation and the rest are buried there.the place is also considered sacred from then on.These are placed in a wooden six wheeled cart pulled by oxen and dragged by the Daitapatis and the others in the group to the Temple. The logs are kept inside the temple in a place known as Koili Vaikuntha. Koili means ""burial ground"" and Vaikuntha means ""Heaven"". It is the place where the old deities will be buried and the new ones made temple in India except the Jagannath temple witnesses the funeral of its deities. After the transfer of ‘Brahma padartha’ the old idols are considered lifeless. 'Kothasunasia’ servitors dig up a pit of around 25 feet in length 20 feet in width and 10 feet deep. Along with the departing idols other wooden idols mounted on the chariots during the Rathyatra – among them ‘sarathi’ horses ‘parshwa devatas’ ‘olata shua’ and ‘dwarapala’ – are also buried in this pit. This process is called ‘patali kriya’.Sri Jagannath temple is the only temple that houses a funeral ground – ‘Koili Baikuntha’ – within its premises.  The carving of the images begin with three oldest 7 of the main wood carvers setting on to work on the image of Lord Jagannath. The three oldest wood carvers will be the main sculptors for the deity of Lord Jagannath. The images of Lord Balabhadra and Devi are simultaneously carved by other two teams consisting of three carvers each.More than 50 carpenters work as assistant to the main carvers.The work is done with utmost confidentiality and not even the head priest of the temple is allowed to visit the place of work. There is a special enclosure inside the temple premises where the carving of the Lord is done. The enclosure is open on the top but is attached with very strong doors. The wood carvers are not supposed to consume anything (eat drink or smoke) once inside the enclosure. The carvings are completed in 21 days and during these 21 days the carvers are not supposed to leave the temple premises. They would sleep in the temple courtyard in the night and have their dinner in the form of Lords Mahaprasad. Devotional songs are sung outside the Koili Baikuntha day and night during throughout this 21 days period. This continuous singing of devotional songs is called “Akhand Bhajan”. While this is done by devadasis and temple musicians shlokas from the Vedas are chanted continuously by Brahmin priests. When the new deities are made they are carried inside the inner sanctum of the temple and placed in front of the old deities facing them. This is again an act that is done with utmost confidentiality as nobody is allowed inside for a Darshan of the Lord not even the temple priests. The three new deities are carried inside only by descendants of the Dayitapati family. Once they are safely inside only the three eldest Dayitapati members can stay. No puja is done at this time and no food is offered. Of the four Jagannath's height is 5' 7"" and His outstretched arms measure 12 ft. across. He weighs so much that when they carry Him 5 persons must be on each arm 20 on His backside and more than 50 in front pulling. Balabhadra is a bit lighter. His height is 5' 5"" and His arms are also 12 ft. across. Subhadra is less than 5' and light. Sudarsana is in a long log-shaped form only. However this log is 5' 10"" in length. The rights of the Great Transformation are accorded only to the Daitapatis as they are considered to be the descendants of the Daitapati who was the first worshipper of the Lord Jagannath. This ceremony takes place three days before the great Chariot Festival. The transformation is complete once the “Brahman” or the life force (also referred to as pinda) is transferred from the old deities to the new. There are different rules attached to this act that the Daitapatis must adhere to. These are:The three Dayitapatis must be blindfolded.They must bind a piece of Lord Jagannath's cloth around their hands before the transfer can begin.They should not have shaved since the first day of the search party procession. This is considered to be the disappearance ceremony of Jagannath also. Traditionally after a member of the family passes away the son does not shave for ten days out of respect for the deceased. The house is also whitewashed after the death of any family member. And since Lord Jagannath is considered to be the Head of their respective households they are required to have their houses whitewashed after this ceremony.The children and all Dayitapati family members wear new clothes on this day of the ""transfer"". This rite is considered to be the most auspicious ritual of all in Jagannath Temple. It is this ceremony itself that is the actual Naba Kalebar Yatra or Transformation Ceremony of Lord Jagannath. The three Dayitapati members fast and meditate the whole day inside the temple. Only after midnight does the transfer of the ""Life Force"" occur and that too in total silence.What’s interesting here is that no Daitapati till date has been able to experience what actually is this “Brahman”. When asked of their experience at this time the Dayitapatis say ""It is very difficult to express what Brahman is. It cannot be seen or touched. Our eyes are blindfolded and our hands are covered with cloth when we carry it. Yet a powerful feeling is very much present like a rabbit jumping in our hands. This is our experience. Beyond this exactly what this Brahman is that is so powerfully felt nobody is able to say"". During the midnight the old deities are carried on the shoulders of the Dayitapatis and buried in the Koili Vaikuntha before dawn. There are three separate graves for the three deities but all the previous Jagannaths are laid to rest in the same grave one on top of the other. It is said that if anybody from outside this select group happens to see any of this ceremony be it from a roof top or otherwise they will surely die. The Govt of Odisha therefore orders a full blackout of light on this one night in the whole town of Puri. On the morning of the second day the new deities are seated on the altar the “Ratna-Singhasana”. On this second day the daily routine of the temple finally begins again after a lapse of nearly 58 days. Sweet-smelling flower garlands and new garments arc given to the new deities food is offered and puja is done. Devotees can again come inside for darshan. And on the third day the new deities emerge from the temple for the biggest Chariot Festival. The Nava Kalevar draws millions of people from across the world to Puri. Nava Kalevar is one of the biggest festivals in the country and draws the most number of people. Scientifically since this Lord is made of wood it needs to be changed regualrly or else it may get spoiled due to long use of rituals climatic impact possible infections by insects and pests etc. Some of the above are borrowed ones from different sources.",Sun Mish,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sun-Mish

He is a tapasvi and he just occupied a seat to do tapas. It is funny to ask for proof of rights from a person to allow him to sit in a forest or in any unoccupied natural spot. That would be the peak of disappointment of Misled formation of rules and regulations on earth imposed by humans. If you are valiant enough to claim that mountain and have a seat in there in that cold weather you are absolutely welcomed by Mahesa and even others will appreciate you. Finally What rights do humans have to define boundaries for animals or to claim lands on Earth? Why do they do that ? Don't say we are intelligent species.

To recite prayer in temple is being religious to develop a prayerful heart is being spiritual.To wear Tilak marks beads is being religious to decorate your inside heart is being spiritual. In front of being spiritual other all are zeroes. But that doesn't mean we should deride ritualistic practices. These are carried from generations to generation.

We were struggling financially though I was working. After two months I fell sick again and was diagnosed with urin infection. Got admitted in hospital for 10 days. I was in bed rest for next one month I had lost my hunger and immune system. My husband got a job but still struggling in his career. After a year even I was on the verge of losing my job so was looking for a new job. So our first two years went pathetic. But as we say nothing is permanent bad days too go. One day my husband went to one jwellary shop to fix his broken gold ring. The shopkeeper was a Muslim. After some general conversation he said you guys are having bad time it seems. The shop was next to my apartment and thus he used to see me as well every day. I had also noticed him many times watching me and we had passed a smile. He himself told my husband she is having tough time both health and career wise. He called us together. Next day we both went to him he saw us did some meditation and asked us to perform some rituals instructed by him. We did and went to him again. Then he said you guys have a very powerful deity as Hanuman ji. Even being a Muslim I am a big follower of him and perform prayers to him everyday. He asked us to visit Hanuman temple on every Tuesday and Saturday. According to his instructions we started visiting chanting Hanuman chalisa offering coconuts and encircling the temple. Probably you will not believe but we started feeling some change. I got better job within a month. Slowly started recovering as well. I am now a big follower of Hanuman ji. My husband is settled now in his career and wears a gold pendant of Hanuman. I have a great faith that he comes whenever I call him. I have a two years old child. Whenever he doesn't eat his food I just close my eyes and pray to him. I don't know what or how it happens but he starts eating. Our life is better now and I feel grateful to him for all his blessings. The Muslim person who guided me must be a messanger of Hanuman ji. With him I learned: “The religion doesn't drive you. It's your faith that makes you religious.” Stay Calm!,Anshu Bharti,https://www.quora.com/profile/Anshu-Bharti-15

Once there was an old saint who with his meditative powers and yogic karma seeked Lord Shiva’s holy manifestation before him. Lord Shiva thus appeared before the saint and asked him his wish. The conversation went something like this: Saint: “Oh Mahadeva ! I wish to know who is your Father.” To which lord Shiva Replied. “Brahma is my Father!” This may seem obvious as Brahma is known to be the father of all creation.Next the saint followed “Who is your Grandfather?” To which lord Shiva Replied “Vishnu is my Grandfather!” Another story known (perhaps explanation for another time) is that lord Brahma appeared through the lotus bud that sprouted from lord Vishnu’s navel.Now the saint asked “Then who is your Great Grandfather?” And to the astonishment of the saint Lord Shiva replied “I am my Great Grandfather!” This story  like any other Sanatana dharma’s mythology and Vedic teachings is philosophical and symbolic in meaning. It speaks about the circle of life and that the nature or the decisive structure of creation and destruction which is symbolic in characterisation. Lord Shiva is know as Anaadi the starting point of everything.

How could a lone mendicant travelling with not more than four disciples have brought that about? Moreover why would a compassionate being like Adishankara do so? As opposed to such views Shankara’s imminent task was chiefly to bring the diverse and inconsistent philosophical systems within Hindusim into the fold of Vedanta and not to fight those beyond the scope of Vedic religion. The challenges of his times were more internal than external. While it is true that he has refuted Buddhist tenets in his Brahmasutrabhashya where is the proof that he held debates with the Buddhists and worst of all ordered them to be killed? If at all Shankara did hold a debate with Buddhist scholars and defeated them those scholars would have followed Vedanta as this was the norm in those days. Buddhism in India was wiped out because of Islamic Invaders. Dr. BR Ambedkar in his work ‘The decline and fall of Buddhism’ has made this fact amply clear. He saysThere can be no doubt that the fall of Buddhism in India was due to the invasions of the Musalmans. Islam came out as the enemy of the 'But'. The word 'But' as everybody knows is the Arabic word and means an idol. Thus the origin of the word indicates that in the Moslem mind idol worship had come to be identified with the Religion of the Buddha. To the Muslims they were one and the same thing. The mission to break the idols thus became the mission to destroy Buddhism. Islam destroyed Buddhism not only in India but wherever it went. Before Islam came into being Buddhism was the religion of Bactria Parthia Afghanistan Gandhar and Chinese Turkestan as it was of the whole of Asia. . .The Mussalman invaders sacked the Buddhist universities of Nalanda Vikramshila Jagaddala Odantapuri to name only a few. They razed to the ground Buddhist monasteries with which the country was studded. The monks fled away in thousands to Nepal Tibet and other places outside India. A very large number were killed outright by the Muslim commanders. How the Buddhist priesthood perished by the sword of the Muslim invaders has been recorded by the Muslim historians themselves. Summarizing the evidence relating to the slaughter of the Buddhist Monks perpetrated by the Musalman General in the course of his invasion of Bihar in 1197 AD Mr. Vincent Smith says ""....Great quantities of plunder were obtained and the slaughter of the 'shaven headed Brahmans' that is to say the Buddhist monks was so thoroughly completed that when the victor sought for someone capable of explaining the contents of the books in the libraries of the monasteries not a living man could be found who was able to read them. 'It was discovered' we are told 'that the whole of that fortress and city was a college and in the Hindi tongue they call a college Bihar.' ""Such was the slaughter of the Buddhist priesthood perpetrated by the Islamic invaders. The axe was struck at the very root. For by killing the Buddhist priesthood Islam killed Buddhism. This was the greatest disaster that befell the religion of the Buddha in India..Scholars and authors like KS Lal Koenrad Elst Sita Ram Goel and others have made it clear that Islam was the reason why Buddhism was wiped out not only in India but from the entire Asian region between Iran and Malaysia. The fact is that it has not stopped yet as is evidenced by the Taliban blasting of Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan.Also as Prof Elst cites in his writings as late as 2002 there have been incidents in Kargil to convert Buddhists into Islam. It's continuing and there have been clashes between the Buddhists of Ladakh and the Muslims of Kashmir.[1] The propaganda that Adishankara ‘ordered’ the killing of Buddhists and destroying of their monasteries is a ridiculous heinous myth. It is a clever misdirection to discredit Hindus for the acts of someone else.Footnotes[1] Ladakh tense over Muslim-Buddhist ‘love jihad’ marriage - Times of India",Kratu Nandan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Kratu-Nandan

Traditionally even the Raja (king) did not have the right over the wealth of the temple.The erstwhile Islamic rulers in their bigoted iconoclastic zeal took seriously to temple desecration with an estimated 80000 temples destroyed[1]; pillaged plundered and ravaged most of the North Indian temples…the Southern ones being relatively shielded from their barbarism for various reasons. They started the process of taking control of temple riches.Later the British rulers followed suit. Like a huge sponge Britain soaked up the country’s wealth for imperial purposes most of which was centered in temples and simultaneously ruined its industry agriculture and education. By 1863[2] they decided to withdraw control from these “superstitious Indian religious institutions” as they were ‘heathen and false’.What began with the invaders trying to control temple riches continues till today. At present it is the inept and incompetent hands of government interference and incompetence that treats Hindu temples as ‘cash cows’ milking them for benefits. Present Scenario. Hindu Religious Endowments Act 1926 later modified to The Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Act 1951 allows the state governments to take over temples and maintain complete control over their vast properties & assets and appoint boards to look after the finances. State governments have assumed total financial and managerial control over lakhs of Hindu temples across the country through their respective HRCE Acts. The Problem Its quite bizarre that all this applies to Hindu religious places alone. None of it applies to mosques churches or gurudwaras who have their own religious boards to manage their places of worship. How can you have different laws for different denominations?? Whats peculiar is that state governments use the money generated by a temple (donations income from assets etc.) for purposes that have absolutely nothing to do not just with the temple but also with Hindus or Hinduism! Money taken from temples in the name of development doesn’t even benefit the community from which they’re taken. Temples are crumbling priests are impoverished and there’s an irreparable loss to heritage from several millenia ago leaving even the UNESCO officials shocked.[3] There are several serious charges of corruption mismanagement of temple and defalcation. A majority of temples now have no revenue for their upkeep and continue to languish in dilapidated states causing much pain and anguish to the community.,,

By Dharmic religion I presume you mean a religion of Sanatan Dharma. Well as the cliche goes it is not a religion but a way of life. Here the emphasis was not on rigidity to follow a specific god but to find one which suits your need. Like we have different parents we can worship different gods. Like we pursue different careers we could practice different religious techniques. The key is spirituality. Not the gods themselves. Religion was a personal belief. And it is not that Dharmic religions never had the divide with time the fractions of Shivate and Vaishnavites arose. But it doesn't matter. At crux of Vedas everything and everybody is a god. Religion is to worship and celebrate it. The rivers the mountains the winds the sun and the moon all are gods. You are god and so am I! Therefore never was religion propagated with whips. You chose it or you were born with it. Buddhism and Jainism were born out of spirituals among the dharmic yogis. They didn’t intend to preach religion but to preach principle and way of living. It was absorbed by India. Same about the Sikhs. None of these ever tried to convert by force. It is a matter of choice. How can I possibly force you to love my parents more than your own? In the end all lead to one. But Abhramic religions were propagated through force and material influence. Their rigidity has created a void among themselves. Though nothing should matter its all about personal faith. It should be the most private thing of an individual. But when you try to create an empire on peoples personal faith - things are bound to go nasty!,Lal Deopa,https://www.quora.com/profile/Lal-Deopa

RelatedWhy are some Hindus hostile towards ISKCON?,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-some-Hindus-hostile-towards-ISKCON,,I am very much qualified to answer this question. I am from a Tamil shaivaite Hindu family; we pray to Lord Vishnu and his avatars but it is not as much as frequent as our prayers to Lord Shiva Lord Karthikeya and Lord Ganesha and Maa Sakthi. Even my first name Guhan refers to Lord Karthikeya. My first experience with ISKCON was in Bengaluru when I visited the beautiful temple complex of ISKCON Bengaluru with my friends. We danced in joy like fellow worshipers there and I was filled with new energy to explore more. I was spellbound by the appearance of Lord Krishna and Radha and felt magical there. I sensed strong energy there. I wished to be there for sometime and we bought several books to know much about Gita and other discourses about Vaishnavism. It happened in February 2017. When I moved to Pondicherry in July 2017 I was introduced to ISKCON Pondicherry community by some of my friends. I used to go there on Sundays and attend the prayer and do service there. It made me very content and I felt happy. One day I went early to listen to lectures given by one of the gurus there . What I heard in that lecture shocked me. He mentioned that considering any god be it Lord Shiva or anyone closer to Vishnu or equal to Vishnu is one of the greatest sins. He told me that Shiva is a demigod and cannot be equated to Vishnu . I was very much shocked. Born in a shaivaite family I had a feeling that I was cheating on my parents. My parents could never accept this. I was shell shocked. He further proceeded that shaivaites would pray to Vishnu but there cannot be a true vaishnavite who would pray to Shiva. I felt really bad. Though I am a shaivaite I have always seen Vishnu as a god equal to Shiva. Hinduism is all about trimoorthy and Sakthi  but isckon preaches the superiority of single god similar to Abrahamic religions. Only this which makes it different from Abrahamic religions is that it doesn't claim Vishnu as the only god. I found all the statements of the gurus something similar to the preachings of Christian missionaries who always demonize Hindu Gods and make them inferior in front of Jesus. ISKCON is doing the same.,Guhan Priyadharshan Paramasivam,https://www.quora.com/profile/Guhan-Priyadharshan-Paramasivam

Have you ever seen any other Hindu Deity in this world standing with such an unusual placement of His hands like Lord Sri Venkateswara..??I know you haven’t.. Because there’s no other Deity similar to the idol of Lord Sri Venkateswara existing in this world… Secondly most of the devotees who come to Tirumala Temple from many parts of the world do not even know that the principal deity or the Moola Virat of Lord Venkateswara so majestically standing in the Sanctum Sanctorum of the holy TirumalaTemple is in fact having four arms.. While two of these four arms are clearly visible to us the other two are at the back of the Deity in a held up and curled into fists position.. It is through these two empty back arms that Lord Sri Venkateswara is telling us that “Although my two back arms are now empty am still keeping them ready to use my weapons the moment I realize that there’s a threat to humanity in general and to my devotees in particular”.. It is also for this reason that we find His Discus – The Sudarsana Chakra (beside the right posterior upper arm) and His Conch – the Panchajanya (beside the left posterior upper arm) – always kept ready for Him although only as decoration pieces just in case He decides to use them for whatever reason.. However what we actually see on the front side of the Moola Virat are the two anterior arms that the holy Lord Sri Venkateswara has quite unusually placed.. It is such an unusual placement in which the right anterior lower hand of the Holy Lord is bent at His elbow and is held in a supine position while His entire open palm is pointing towards His holy Lotus feet According to the Vedic scriptures such a peculiar hand position is called the Varada Hasta Mudra (The hand that offers boons).. With this mystic Mudra the Holy Lord Venkateswara is very emphatically telling us that “I’m going to stand here on the Tirumala Hills forever to protect my devotees in this unholy Kali Yuga.. For a devotee who has complete faith in my Holy feet am here to take care of him and his entire family during all the times they pass through the problems of this inhuman world” What is further more unusual here is that “Lord Sri Venkateswara’s left anterior lower hand is straight down; bent at the wrist and is found lightly resting just below His left hip.. Such an unusual hand position according to the Vedic scriptures is known as the Katya Vilambita Hastha Mudra” Katya means panegyric or pay homage Vilambita means hanging Hastha means hand and Mudra means posture.. With such an unusual Hasta Mudra the holy Lord Sri Venkateswara is giving us great assurance by saying “As long as my devotees have complete faith in Me I shall not allow the flood waters of this Bhava Sagara (Ocean of problems) go beyond their hip level”. “Sri Venkatesa Charanam Saranam Prapathye” This beautiful article is written by Shri Nareenaditya komaragiri ji.

The price is 250 rupees and it has around 450 pages. The language is simple easy to understand and fast moving Once you will read this book your several myths created by the TV serials face book fan groups modern day retelling would break like anything.Once you have gained interim knowledge of the Mahabharata and if you want to be an advanced learner go for:Bibek Debroy’s BORI critical edition Mahabharata- It is available in 10 volumes on Amazon. BORI is name of an institute (under a programme of Indian government which went for decades) which scrutinized all possible available 1259 Mahabharata manuscripts in the Indian subcontinent. They weeded out several interpolations or popular but fake stories. The language is difficult on several instances and it would require huge passion of the reader to go through it. Every volume has nearly 550 pages describing every duel between primer characters with best possible details. For an example one of its volume has three day of Mahabharata war explained in 550 pages. Every volume would cost around 350-450 on Amazon. This would book could be used as reference when two parties are arguing on Mahabharata content.Another book giving a contest to BORI’S Mahabharat is KMG Mahabharat- Kisari Mohan Ganguli’s Mahabharat. This is also an unabridged version means tale with no fictional/unaltered subject. The text of this book is also available on internet as a free domain. Its language is also tough on most of the occasions.Now for people who like reading fiction in the name of Mahabharata or those who perceived that Akbar was like Hrithik as shown in Jodha Akbar movie. Or Ranvir Singh and Shahrukh Khan as showcased in Bajirao Mastani and Asoka respectively were Bollywood lovers nor ferocious warriors could go for this popular category. It includes re-telling or Mahabharata from the lens of one character. Jaya Karna’s wife Palace of illusion and many are all very popular books. The authors have great writing style which suits their agenda and skill set to create entertainment while reading these fiction books in name of re-telling the Mahabharata. Note- they are not at all any where near to authenticity however face book fan clubs continue to take reference from these categories of books/fiction novel to glorify their hero or demean other characters.Honorable mention- If you want your kids to learn about the enchanting knowledge of epics please go for Amar Chitra Katha’s Mahabharat. It has 3 books set which cost around 2000. I have recently bought for my kids and it’s great to generate interest in our rich Hindu culture. Avid Hindi readers can also go for Geeta press’s Mahabharat.

The chronology in the following narration is based on the findings of Vedveer Arya who has studied the astronomical data of the Vedas and Itihasa in detail. The scholars of the Vedic period including the period of Indus valley civilization were keen stargazers. They have mentioned the stellar (constellation) and planetary positions at the times of many important events. By putting those data in the modern planetarium software we can get the dates of those events. For the sake of brevity the details are skipped here and only a few events are mentioned. The earliest recorded astrological data refers to 15962 BC when the five-year yuga calendar was introduced. It means that the practice of stargazing and therefore Vedic civilization is older than 16000 BC. It was an ice age civilization when controlled fire was essential for survival. Therefore the worship of fire in the following forms was the mainstay of the civilization. Akhanda Deepa: a continuously burning lamp in every home so that fire is always available. Its going off was deemed to be a bad omen. The lamp had to be relit after penance. Akhanda Homa: a continuously burning fire in an open pit maintained in every village. Fire temple: built and maintained by the kings. Now hardly a dozen are left among the Zoroastrians. Arani Manthan: In spite of the aforesaid sources of fire it was deemed essential that the art of making new fire is not lost. Therefore for every Yajnya which the Brahmins had to do often new fire had to be lighted by Arani Manthan. Thus Agni is the God of fire and acceptor of sacrifices. He was considered an intermediary between Gods and men. 200 hymns have been devoted to only Agni in Rig Veda while Agni is mentioned in 218 hymns. Tradition of fire worship is reflected in all Vedas. Prayer from Ishavasyopanishad: अग्नॆ नय सुपथा रायॆ अस्मान् विश्वानि दॆव वयुनानि विद्वान् । युयॊध्यस्मज्जुहुराणमॆनो भूयिष्ठं तॆ नम उक्तिं विधॆम ॥ Oh Fire! Lead us onto the virtuous path! Oh Divine! You are aware of everything! Remove the abundance of our crooked acts! We expressively offer thee salutations! In the Neolithic age with the spread of agriculture and large-scale domestication of animals the other forces of nature were recognised as gods like Indra (for rain) Vayu Varun Aditya (Sun) and planets. In fact all phenomena like knowledge (Saraswathi) prosperity (Laxmi) power (Shakti) illusion (Maya) sleep (Nidra Devi) etc. were treated as gods. The Vedic seers realised the all-pervading divinity in all of them. They also realised that every form of life is a part of the all-pervading divinity and does not end with the death of the body. Upanishads were written to explain the all-pervading divinity. Even today all natural phenomena and other divinities (like Shiva Parvathi Laxmi Ganesh Saraswathi etc.) are worshipped with the lighting of lamps and a Homa. One of the most important events was the beginning of Vaivaswatha Manvantara around 14480 BC a time marked by devastating floods around the area now known as the area of Indus Valley Civilization. At that time the winter solstices were at Mrigasira. The most important ancient date recorded in detail was Varsh Pratipada (22nd February 6778 BC) when Sun moon and all the five planets were in the same constellation. That was the date given in Surya Siddhanta by Mayasura. The vedic accounts clearly mention extensive trades among different communities. Additions to the Vedas continued through the period of Ramayana. Maharshi Valmiki has described the stellar (constellations) and planetary positions at the times of some of the events described in Ramayana. When those positions are entered in Planeraum software they give the following dates. Birth of Bhagwan Rama: 10th January 5114 BC Start of Rama Vanvas: 5th January 5089 BC Battle with Khar Dushan: 7th October 5077 BC Victory over Ravana (death of Ravana: 4th December 5076 BC Completion of the exile of Rama: 2nd January 5075 BC During Mahabharat period sage Veda Vyasa compiled and classified all available Vedic knowledge. 3102 BC was the start of the Kaliyugabda calendar still so widely used in all parts of India. All rituals were incorporated in the Karmakand and the Panchang which are still in use. On the basis of the time line referred above the Vedic civilization including Indus valley civilization can be classified as follows. 1. Pre Vedic: before 15962 BC. 2. Proto Vedic period: from 15962 BC to 14480 BC 3. Early Vedic: from 14480 BC to 6778 BC. 4. Late Vedic (period of Itihasa): from 6778 BC to 3102 BC 5. Post Vedic: after 3102 BC when no more Vedic hymns are added. Most of the Puranas available today were written from 3100 BC onwards. Please note that the aforesaid classification of the periods is not by Vedveer Arya.

It had uniform weights and measures uniform pattern of urban planning water management street layouts drainage system etc. for such long period a continuity and stability which has not been matched by any other civilization including the highly advanced modern Eurocentric civilizations. The historians and archaeologists have no clue about the rulers who made such a civilization possible. The only way to arrive at the correct answer is to refer to the Panchang. “According to the Panchang who were the rulers of Indus valley civilization?” Most of our friends do not understand the question. A few friends object to it on the ground that Panchang is only a calendar and not a historic document. We overlook the fact that every calendar is the result of an important historic event. For example if today is in 2022 AD: From the Julian (now Gregorian) calendar we learn that Julius Caesar and Jesus Christ lived around 2022 (solar) years before today. Similarly from Hijri calendar we learn that Prophet Muhammad migrated from Mecca to Medina about 1444 lunar (not solar) years before today. From Vikram Samvat we learn that King Vikram consolidated his empire around 2071 years before today and from Shalivahan Shakabda we learn that King Shalivahan completed his victory over the Shaka intruders about 1944 years before today. In addition to all the aforesaid and a few other calendars the Panchang gives KALIYUGABDA which is the basis of all important festival and other days of the solar as well as lunar year. There have been concerted and systematic (partly successful) attempts by the Muslim and Christian invaders to make the Indians forget about KALIYUGABDA; but somehow it has refused to be forgotten. The year KALIYUGABDA 5125 began from 22nd March 2023 AD. Thus it was started by the rulers who ruled about 5125 years before today which was the time of Indus Valley Civilization. The fact that KALIYUGABDA has remained pivotal to Indian culture for more than five millennia shows the stronghold of those rulers over the entire civilization. Those who have studied Indus Valley Civilization must have noticed that the “consolidation phase” of Indus Valley Civilization started around 5000 years before today. The consolidation was possible because of the stronghold of the rulers of the dynasty over the entire civilization and other parts of India. Now which king of which dynasty started the calendar of KALIYUGABDA? It is common knowledge that Kaliyuga started when Bhagwan Krishna left his mortal body; but the calendar did not start on the same day; it started on the date of the coronation of King Parikshit the grandson of Arjun as King Yudhishthira abdicated the throne and along with his brother and their wife left for the Himalayas. Thus the descendants of King Parikshit were the paramount rulers of the Indus valley and the rest of India from around 3100 BC till about 1600 BC. All the surviving traditions and literature of Hinduism were codified during that period and popularised through the religious tradition of tourism that we call Theerthatan. From a careful and critical examination of the descriptions of Shanti Parva Anushasan Parva and Ashvamedha Parva of Mahabharat as well as the descriptions of other Puranas it is clear that after the battle of Kurukshetra the Pandavas had become the paramount power of entire India along with the adjoining territories and their suzerainty was accepted by all the other rulers. This tradition continued during the rule of the descendants of King Parikshit. The relationship of the descendants of king Parikshit with all the other kings in and around India was like the relationship of the British crown with the princely states in and around India *from 1858 to 1947). It is important to note that by 3100 BC the river Saraswati (earlier known as Sarah Vathi as it passed through a series of lakes) had already dried up. River Shatadru had already got diverted towards West and river Jamuna had already got diverted to the East due to tectonic movements. KINGS OF THE DYNASTY OF YUDHISTHIRA The consolidation phase of Indus valley civilization flourished during the millennium of uninterrupted peace following the holocaust of Mahabharata war. The most important ruling dynasty of the area during the time was the dynasty of King Parikshit. Subsequent to the war the capital was shifted from Hastinapur to Koshambi. Immediately after the war the kings of this dynasty were the suzerain rulers of the whole of India. But in course of time their influence progressively declined till the time of the end of the dynasty when their influence was limited only to the small area around their capital Kaushambi. The kings of the dynasty after the Mahabharata war were as follows: 1. Yudhishthira 2. Parikshit 3. Janmejaya 4. Shatanika 5. Aswamedhadatta 6. Adhisimha Krishna 7. Nickaknu 8. Ushna 9. Chitraratha 10. Suchiradha 11. Vrishnimanta 12. Sushena 13. Suneedha 14. Nrupegakshu 15. Sukhibala 16. Pariplava 17. Sunaya 18. Medhavi 19. Ripunjaya 20. Urva 21. Thigma 22. Brihadratha 23. Kasudana 24. Shatanika II 25. Udayana 26. Kihinara 27. Dandapani 28. Niramitra 29. Kshemaka According to the Puranas King Kshemaka lost the war with Mahapadmananda sometime after 1634 BC. Thus according to the Panchang and the Puranas King Yudhishthira and his dynasty ruled from 3138 BC to about 1600 BC as the paramount rulers of India and the adjoining areas. During the period of more than a millennium long paramountcy of Pandav dynasty uniformity was established all over India such as uniform length measurements weights and time measurements in addition to uniform urban planning road networks drainage system etc. This uniformity was strengthened through imperial encouragement to religious tourism that is known as Theerthatan. In fact the foundation of modern Hinduism was laid during the consolidation phase of IVC. It is important to note that the mighty river (later known as Saraswathi) which was at its maximum around 70000 BC with waterflow more than the modern Amazon river was steadily declining after about 40000 BC. By 5100 BC it had been reduced to a series of lakes (Sarah) with the remnant water and a river (Sarah Vathi) flowing through them. The name Sarah Vathi later became Saraswathi When there was acute shortage of water due to climate change and the system of lakes and the river joining them dried up while the cities on the west bank of Sindhu river were affected by frequent devastating floods most of the settlements were abandoned. The people migrated to the East and South. This process of migration was very slow and lasted over a period of more than a millennium. Modern history books state that King Mahapadmananda ruled from Patliputra around 330 BC. The Puranas state that he was coronated at Rajagriha (Rajgir) in the year 1504 years after the birth of King Parikshit which according to the Panchang was in 3138 BC. Thus according to the Puranas King Mahapadmananda ruled from Rajagriha from 1634 BC.

However just as Midas’ gift had the downside that it turned every single thing he touched into gold Ashwapati’s gift’s downside was that he had to keep whatever he understood from the birds a secret and if he told anyone his head would burst on the spot (a metaphor for “He would die”). So one day he was standing on his palace balcony with his wife when he heard the song of two love-birds (literally!) and accidentally laughed out loud. The queen laughed at her husband’s sudden outburst and asked him “What is the thought that brings such joy to you my Lord?” He realised his blunder and smiled sheepishly at her replying “Nothing dear.” “Oh what is there between husband and wife? Please tell me. Let me laugh with you.” Taken aback by his wife’s persistence Ashwapati sighed and told her his gift along with the terrible side effect. “So you see my Queen if I were to tell you what I heard my head would burst.” She shook her head still smiling and said “It does not matter. I need to know what the birds said that made you laugh in such a manner.” Now the king became angry. He had told her the reason for why he couldn’t tell her and she continues to persist? Did she have any love for him? So he banished her away from the palace and Kekeya itself. This is why Kaikeyi was brought up by the hand-maid Manthara. ~ ~ ~ With Kaikeyi’s story however we must remember that she and Manthara were mere pawns in the game of Lord Vishnu’s as He was born as Rama with the purpose of defeating the Rakshasa Ravana in Lanka for the people of Earth who couldn’t stand Ravana’s terrorising. Rama couldn’t pick a random fight with Ravana if he stayed on at Ayodhya for His whole life as Ravana never personally afflicted the land. The Lord’s plan to defeat Ravana would only have happened if Kaikeyi had exiled Rama so He could have a reason for bringing down Ravana. In a lecture I once heard Kaikeyi’s banishment of Rama was described as a “service to Him” and after much thought I realised that the Lord really did go to a lot of extremes to destroy evil (Vinaashaaya-Dushkrutha) and establish Dharma (Dharma-Samsthapa) in that age and it strengthens our own beliefs that whatever we or another person may do to ourselves He has a super reason behind it and do as Krishna said in His Gita: “Maam Ekam Sharanam Vraja… Maa Shuchaha” - Surrender unto Him only and do not worry. ~ ~ ~ Coming back to the original topic… To end this the Ramayana really is a treasure trove isn’t it?! :D Jai Shri Ram!,Mira Mohan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Mira-Mohan-4

In a mandir you do not have to have a specifically consecrated temple priest (dīkṣita arcaka). Anyone from any community men women gender fluid race or caste is entitled to perform puja - with the scantiest amount of training - known as a pūjāri or pūjarinī. All South Indian temples are built managed and have their rituals performed according to the Āgamas/Tantras. In these temples built according to strict rules and measurements of Sacred Architecture the ceremonies can only be performed by special priests - males and brahmins (some non-brahmins are now being trained to serve in the temples.) The priests undergo several years of training in the Tantric rituals as young lads and are then formally initiated into the temple priesthood through maṇḍala dīkṣa rites. Once thus consecrated they take up service in one of ālayas — technical word for a “Tantric” temple. As a clarificatory note for the uninformed; TANTRA simply means tanayati jñānam anena iti tantra. “Tantra is that (system) by which knowledge is spread.” The Saiva and Vaishnava canon of Tantra are called Āgamas and those of the Goddess are referred to as Tantras. Both terms are interchangeable. The Tantrik path is bifurcated into Right-hand Tantra (dakṣinācāra) and Left-hand (vāmācāra - Vamachara - Wikipedia). Right-handed Tantra or more specifically Āgama is patriarchal orthodox conventional and symbolic in its usages and practices and dedicated only to universal well-being. Left-handed Tantra on the other hand is matriarchal heterodox transgressional in practice and inverts and subverts all the “brahminical” norms and structures and social values.Diagram of an Ālaya.,Rami Sivan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Rami-Sivan

Jai Srila Prabhupada. Not only does Vaishnava Acharyas say so but Srimad Bhagavatam also has the same view. SB 5.12.11: What then is the ultimate truth? The answer is that nondual knowledge is the ultimate truth. It is devoid of the contamination of material qualities. It gives us liberation. It is the one without a second all-pervading and beyond imagination. The first realization of that knowledge is Brahman. Then Paramātmā the Supersoul is realized by the yogīs who try to see Him without grievance. This is the second stage of realization. Finally the full realization of the same supreme knowledge is realized in the Supreme Person (Bhagavan). All learned scholars describe the Supreme Person as Vāsudeva the cause of Brahman Paramātmā and others. There are two reasons for this: 1. When the true nature of Bhagavan is made clearly visible Brahman is automatically understood. Srila Jiva Gosvami says that Brahman which has no manifest qualities is the first step towards Bhagavan realization — nirvikalpataya saksatkrteh prathamikatvat. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura quotes a verse from Sisupala-vadha by the poet Magha to elucidate this point. As Narada had the mystic power to fly he approached by way of the sky: “Sri Krsna first saw him as a bright mass of effulgence. When he came closer He could understand that it was some being having a body. When he came still closer He saw a human form. When he landed in front of them He finally recognized him as Sri Narada.” (Sisupala Vadha 1.3) This verse explains how Krsna’s perception changed step by step from seeing a mass of effulgence to seeing Narada Muni. Krsna's first perception of Narada Muni is akin to Brahman realization and the last is like Bhagavan realization. Based on His first experience He could only say that there was something and that it was effulgent. He could not say anything specific about Narada. But when He recognized him as Narada He knew him as the son of Brahma His own devotee who carries a vina the guru of Dhruva and Prahlada and so on. The first experience is the indeterminate realization of Narada the final one is the determinate experience of the same person. If Bhagavan is rightly understood one will know Brahman in the proper perspective. In fact one cannot come to a thorough understanding of Brahman without understanding Bhagavan inasmuch as one cannot understand sunlight without the sun. 2. Devotee who has realized Bhagavan is naturally endowed with Brahma-jnana. Pure devotees however attain Brahman realization without consciously striving for it through adherence to the rules of the jnana-marga. Because they have no particular interest in Brahman per se they do not linger upon it. When a stack of paper is stapled each sheet is actually pierced individually but it happens so quickly that it appears to happen simultaneously. This is called the sata-patra-bhedana-nyaya. Vachanamrut Gadhada I-1: “The shãstras state that there is no greater achievement for a person whose mind’s vrutti is constantly focused on the murti (Personal Form) of Bhagvãn. This is because the murti of Bhagvãn is like a chintãmani. Just as a person who possesses a chintãmani attains whatever he desires a person whose mind’s vrutti is constantly focused on the murti of Bhagvãn can instantly see if he so wishes the svarups of jeev Mãyã and Brahm. He can also see Vaikunth Golok and other dhãms of Bhagvãn.” When a devotee realizes Bhagavan by the grace of Bhagavan he can realize Brahman any time without any hard efforts. But devotees don’t have any desire for that because they just want to render devotional service to Bhagavan. That’s why Vaishnava Acharyas prefer the realization of Bhagavan.,Ojas Shrivastava,https://www.quora.com/profile/Ojas-Shrivastava-11

After the long time of prayer devi adiparashakti listen to them and devi adiparashakti gave them darshan in her real formShe told them who is she the mother of all beings and the tridev also originated from her then tridev told them about the problem and wanted to know why they are unable to complete the creation of the universe then she told that nothing in this universe can be accomplish by the prsence or contribution of shakti or woman presence . Then they ask what is the solution she gave a solution so to help you i will separate myself into three halves Without knowledge brahma cannot complete the creation of the universe so he with have a consort the goddess of knowledge- SarasvatīWithout luxuries the universe cannot be managed so with vishnu the consort will be one who will be the goddess of wealth ie goddess lakshmiFor destruction we need immense energy so his consort will be her ultimate form ie goddess shakti the goddess of powerActually they were all the forms of adiparashakti So now come to another part of question that was will they listen to our prayers and do they know about us ? Yes ofcourse  they know about all of us as they are mothers of universe they are mother of all of the beings and they know everything about us and always want our well-being So I hope this will help to all my curious readers if you like my article do upvote it Thank you may goddess adiparashakti bless tou all and keep of you safe and healthy in this corona outbreak,Tanishqua Uniyal,https://www.quora.com/profile/Tanishqua-Uniyal

But Being majority in 2 countries Hindus don’t have even one country which is officially Hindu. But its Really a bad Idea!! The best True Secularism instead of minority appeasing secularism Because you are giving way to other questions like What about Sikh India? What about Jain India? This can be considered as discrimination towards indigenous religious minorities. Finally India should be a secular state. Better to establish a Dharmic state where all sects of Hinduism Buddhism Sikhism Jainism comes under it. But State should be separated from religion. Even ceremonial things can not be done in Hindu state because there are different traditions in different parts of India. Even if there is any single largest tradition it will be also a minority followed tradition.,Abhinaya Roopa,https://www.quora.com/profile/Abhinaya-Roopa

But if you see everything as equal then their would be no war etc. No greed etc. Too. The worship lets the worshipper focus the mind and remind him that everything is fundamental propert. Its just its kinda different method. Actually same is the reasoe Hindus worship idols. Since the ultimate reality can't be understood by mind so we assume that Ultimate reality in an idol and worship it. To understand what I have written.

The Tarasara upanishad also calls him an incarnation of Bhagwan Shiv :“From the letter U came Upenḍra  named Hari. From the letter M came Śiva known as Hanumān . Binḍu is named Īśvara and is Śaṭrughna the Lord of the discus itself.”[reference : Tarasara upanishad]Here also Just like Upendra i.e Vaman avatar is called an as Hari Lord Hanuman is described as Lord Shiva. These two are enough to prove the fact that Lord Hanuman is an incarnation of God Shiva. there are other sources as well Like The ekadashi Armour of Lord Hanuman dedicated to His universal form where he assumed the combined powers of all Gods including God Shiva and God Rama. Tulsidasji has mentioned in his Dohawali and geetawali that Lord Shiva left his original form and came up as Lord Hanuman. The kamba Ramayan also mentions a similar thing :When the wind God told that he is represented by Maruthi All the other devas told that they have decided to be born AS monkeys who will destroy enemies in earth And Lord Shiva who burnt the three cities told that He would be born as Hanuman and so he asked “How can there be sorrow to all people in the world?”[reference : Kamba Ramayana Baal kand]King vibhishan has mentioned him as Rudravatar Sage agastya has mentioned him as an avatar of God Shiva There are thousands of mantra shabar mantras and Tantric mantras that call him avatar of Lord Shiva. Hence It is Obvious that God Hanuman is an incarnation of God Shiva himself.He is all powerful He is the greatest devotee of Lord Ram He is the dearheart of Maa sita His status is above all. All those Fake novels that Show the battle of Lord parashuram and Lord Hanuman are fake even I can write a novel saying I was the one who defeated Ravan and in a similar way That Folklore of Lord Hanuman losing his tale is completely bogus and as a matter of fact the entire tale behind the folklore is fake and completely contradicts the Ramayana.

The Hindu supreme god Brahman automatically detects and solves problems with absolute reliability and efficiency. However people of this era have no idea of what Brahman is. Moreover a society can’t have Brahman as god for several reasons. A single god is simpler to use. However surrendering to such a god with no knowledge of its properties would make the god unreliable. We have to be at the mercy of that god.From the earliest days of Hinduism Hindu sages knew that an idea is processed into an action in many stages. They didn’t know how many stages are there and in what order they are. They also knew that the properties of the mechanism that converts an idea into an action was not compatible with languages and can only be described allegorically. This resulted in the generation of many human like characters.In the Puranic period it was realized that the idea was processed into actions in seven stages and each stage was considered as a basic Hindu god.This resulted in the seven basic Hindu gods we are familiar with it.It has to be realized that Judaism Christianity and Islam originated in places where geographical conditions were harsh and uniform. It is for this reason that they are monotheistic.In marked contrast to this Hinduism originated in India which is geographically extremely diverse.The mighty Ganges makes a large part of idea fertile.At the other extremity is the Thar desert of Rajasthan.Even in the same place fortunes keep fluctuating.Conditions may become extremely hostile.The two halves of the same city are absolutely contrasting.As a rule Shakti is the god / goddess of choice in villages.For people of cities Vishnu and Shiva are better choices.For people who want dramatic improvements in life Shani is the god of choice.Some people have to make crucial decisions and wait for the right opportunity indefinitely.For such people Rudra a state of Shiva is the best choiceA Hindu can use gods whose use is not even known clearly.

Tulabhram is not even found in Harivamsa Purana Vishnu Purana and Srimad Bhagvatam but it is found in Padma Purana.She is BHU DEVI! She is the one who has been nourshing us since endless lifetimes and carrying her children(us). She is Kshama Avatara.She is Mata VARAHI. Without her nobody can reach to Krsna:salutations to BhUmi Devi the divine consort of Lord SrinivAsan and is the cause behind the removal of all obstacles (PrathigAthAnam vaaraNam) that stand in the way of Her Lord’s KaruNai reaching us. She is the embodiment of forbearance (Kshamaa) and in that form She facilitates the uninterrupted flow of Her Lord’s Dayaa to us the SamsAris. Bhumi Devi is the bearer of the Universe (Viswa dhAriNee) with all of its charAcharams (sentients and insentients). She makes Her Lord put up with our many trespasses to His sAsthrams. You who are blessed with all good things are the body of the boar of the Sri Varaha who playfully lifted the earth. you have your head decorated by the crescent and you are the one who occupied the left side of Lord Shiva you the wife of Sri Varah please bless us allA fighter and warrior woman was born in palace of King Satrajit. Although men were taught to fight but here her skills were enough to make any men go weak (even Narakasura). She fell in love with Vasudeva. She is described to be beauty with brain and having different good qualities:The Lord married Satyabhāmā in proper religious fashion. Possessed of excellent behavior along with beauty broad-mindedness and all other good qualities she had been sought by many men.(S.B)Now coming to Parijat tree when Narada muni presented Parijata flower to Sri Krsna since Devi Rukmini was side he gave it to her. Now Narada Muni said:The goddess daughter of Satrajit (Satyabhama) the best among women faithful to her husband who is always proud of her good fortune and the beauty of her soul will now know about this.(Harivamsa:2-65-39)When someone said her these like other women in that era she could not be submissive. She stood for her honour! She was possessive because her love was immense. She would not leave anyone who would talk bad about her husband or her. The thing that triggered her was that Sri Krsna was present there when Narad Muni was talking about Devi Satyabhama:“O the one with eyes as beautiful as blue lotus flower! I will not believe this even if I see it in a dream. But I heard in some other way as you were seeing it.” Let the sage with high splendour (Narada) desire so. O lord! My anger in this is about your presence there.You said that good people live in this world for honour. Then I do not want to live losing my honour. Now I have fear from where I had protection before. The one who protected me all over is not doing so now.(Harivamsa)She even said she did not want Parijata tree when it came to her husband’s fame:“Nay sakra fly not..You must not suffer shame: here take the Pārijāta tree; let the gods be no longer annoyed. Sachi inflated with pride of her husband has not welcomed me to her dwelling with respectful presents. As a woman I am light of purpose and am anxious for my husband's fame; therefore have I instigated Śakra this contest with you. But I do not want the Pārijāta tree nor do I wish to take that which is another's property. Sachi is proud of her beauty” - Vishnu Purana.She was warrior. She instead of living in house like other women did in that era accompined Sri Krsna in wars to help him. For her he was no god and equal to her:“Seeing Vasudeva in that condition Satyabhama fanned him with chamaras and Garuda with his wings. Krishna finding relief and regaining consciousness gave Satyabhama his bow Sarnga which can be wielded in battle only with difficulty due to its great weight and told her: ""Devi battle now with Naraka. I am suffering and I am tired from the fighting."" When Devi Satyabhma was told thus she the noble one who always spoke the truth began to battle with the evil Naraka. Satya the wife of the wielder of Sarnga pierced Naraka with sharp narachas crescent-shaped arrows and with bhallas.”She was bold and had commanding nature.She could not live without her husband for long so they would travel together. Everything she did was to make Sri Krishna happy. So her fault was to treat Sri Krishna as mortal and best friend unlike others who considered him as god? Her nature and Devi Radha’s nature is similar and Rukmini Devi’s nature and Chandravali Devi’s nature is similar. Her dominant nature was liked by Sri Krsna since he is true feminist:“O goddess! When it is known in the world that I am your servant O best among the beautiful! why are you not ordering me as before?” - ||2-66-40Sri Krsna always took her when they would travel outside:Then Kesava the slayer of Madhu also called Janardana having conversed on various agreeable themes with the illustrious sons of Pandu and with those Brahmanas that were headed by Markandeya and having bid them farewell mounted his car and called for Satyabhama.SHE IS TRUTH HERSELF!Satya tormented Naraka as the truth torments liars.How much she is loved by Sri Krsna is mentioned so many times in scriptures. When someone caused pain to Satyabhama Sri Krsna was in rage:Then Satyaki informed the slayer of Madhu as to how Kritavarma had behaved towards Satrajit for taking away from him the celebrated gem Syamantaka. Hearing the narrative Satyabhama giving way to wrath and tears approached Keshava and sitting on his lap enhanced his anger (for Kritavarma).(Mausalya Parva)Sri Krsna immediately ran to Satyabhama Devi when Narada ji left to console her:Quickly he went to the great house of SatyabhAmA. That house was built by vishvakarma at the beautiful place of raivataka. Thinking that his proud wife the daughter of Satrajit dear to him greater than his life must be angry Krishna approached as if with hesitation. Thinking that the goddess is angry seemingly with the concept of love the slayer of Madhu entered hesitatingly with fear.(Harivamsa)When Satyabhama Devi became angry on her he showed his love to her :Reaching near her the one with eyes as beautiful as lotus  quickly collected the water flowing from her face as beautiful as the lotus flower in his hands. Sprinkling the water the tears from the eyes of his dear wife on his chest the lord the one with the mark of Srivastava on his chest.(Harivaṃśa)She loved him so much that she became friend with her husband’s friend. Draupadi became her very good friend. Sri Krsna Satyabhama Devi Draupadi and Arjuna ji would seat together and go on picnics where no one were allowed to visit:  She and Draupadi were very close to each other. They would discuss with each about their love life where it is clear that her possessiveness was due to her immense love for the lord:By adopting it duly dear friend thou will be able to draw away thy lord from other females. In all the worlds including that of the celestials there is no god equal O Satyabhama unto the husband.He even gave a necklace which was not given to anyone else:Devi Satyabhama Lord Krishna's Shakti then with an arrow separated the head of Naraka's charioteer from his body. Krishna the Glorious One then became delighted and hugged her and wiped off the perspiration on her born of battle strain. Krishna the Great Soul then pleased with her gave her a necklace that he had not given [even] to Rukmini. This glorious necklace renowned the world over that he [as Vamana] had snatched from Bali during Bali's sacrifice. [69 1/2]Sri Krsna himself has described her qualities as being patient and all her eternal qualities as she is Bhu Devi herself:The qualities such as patience etc. on the earth sound etc. in the sky my love for you O the one with the splendour of the heart of lotus the divine apitite of fire the brightness of sun the beauty of the moon are certainly eternal. - 2-66–44&45She was her “GODDESS OF HIS LIFE”. They had friendly relation. No one was submissive nor dominant:maivaM padmapalAshAkShi prANeshvari vada priye | O one with eyes as beautiful as petals of lotus! O the goddess of my life! Do not speak like this.Now according to some andh bhakts of Radha Krishna serial say she was jealous of Devi Rukmini! The following line says how they Krishna is inseperable to both of them:Rukminī Satyabhamabhyaam sahitham KrishnamaashrayeSatyabhama Devi even praised Rukmini Devi. Now if she was jealous why would she praise her:Like Abhimanyu they are all staying at Dwaravati delighted with the place. And Subhadra also cheerfully and with her whole soul looketh after them like thee and like thee joyeth in them and deriveth much happiness from them. Indeed she grieveth in their griefs and joyeth in their joys. And the mother of Pradyumna also loveth them with her whole soul. Source : KMG Mahabharata Vana Parva Section CCXXXIII.All wives of Sri Krsna had no tinge of impurity. It is also mentioned that they were not jealous of each other as shown in tv serial:With all their desires satisfied by lord nArAyaNa the women did not feel jealous (about each other) even though their mind and eyes were devoted to the same one (kR^iShNa).” -2-88-20 “All the beautiful women held their heads high with pride having kR^iShNa as husband.” 2-88-21And this is what Sri Krsna says to her:“O beautiful! Among all the women who are to be honoured and respected I do not have love and respect in no one except you. Source : Vishnu Puran.Thanks Sailesh Raut bhaiya for references!

Once the lord killed the demon still Narashima was in uncontrollable anger which even any other gods or asuras feared to go near to him. Even lord shiva tried to his ultimate power to control narashima but Bhaktha praglathan was not harmed instead blessed by Narashima. It was very clear that Bhaktha Pragalathan had done what other gods cant do.2. In hinduism there are plenty of asuras and devas tried to get boon to be im-mortal. Even great asuras like hirinyakashibu ravana was unable to get the boon even after performing years of thava. But our beloved bhakth Markendaya got the boon to be immortal from lord shiva. Markendaya got what no other powerful asuras tried to get.In hinduism Gods are not powerful because each God treats their bhakts more than them. Hinduism is such a beautiful religion. They will do anything for bhakths. According to me lord shiva respects workships Lord vishnu and vice versa. So lord shiva tries to make lord vishnu win and lord vishnu will try to make shiva win. Whoever wins the credit goes to opposite. So both of them will never loose if they had a fight.,Satheesh,https://www.quora.com/profile/Satheesh-108

RelatedIs stoicism mentioned in Sanatana Dharma?,https://www.quora.com/Is-stoicism-mentioned-in-Sanatana-Dharma,,Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in Athens in the early 3rd century BC. Stoicism is a philosophy of personal ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world. According to its teachings as social beings the path to eudaimonia (happiness) for humans is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or fear of pain by using one's mind to understand the world and to do one's part in nature's plan and by working together and treating others fairly and justly. (Wikipedia)These concepts are very much to be found in the schools of Indian Philosophy and especially in the Bhagavad Gita.

How it would be if devotees feel free to share their miseries directly to god?Yes ‘Parassinikkadavu Muthappan Temple’ located in Kannur district of Kerala is an odd temple where everyone feels equality and finds their soul. Principal deity of the temple is Sree Muthappan a manifestation of two mythical characters called Thiruvappana and Vellattam. According to the local tradition the presiding deity is a folk deity and not a vedic deity but there are recent attempts to associate the deity to Vishnu or Shiva. Rituals of the temple are unique. They do not follow the Satvic Brahminical form of worship as in other Hindu temples of Kerala or in anywhere else.Yes an Indian temple offers all these without any discrimination to its devotees. Edit 1: Chorunnu-Giving first rice grain to a baby This temple is famous for Chorunnu- a Hindu ceremony performed in Kerala for a six month child. 'Chor' means rice in Malayalam and 'unu' means meals. Hence the name Chorunnu. So this is where many Keralities start eating their staple food ‘Rice’:-)Edit 2: Fish meat and toddy as customary offerings (No offence please) Yes! You heard it right. I have already mentioned that this temple is unique in that it does not follow the Satvic Brahmanical form of worship as in other Hindu temples of Kerala. The mythical stories say that he was the son of the jungle and wore the skin of animals like Siva and hunted animals for food. So obviously Muthappan is not a god who eats sweet confectionary or costly fruits or drinks payasam. He is the son of forest who likes whatever the nature gives:-) Muthappan Temple - Wikipedia Click on the below link to know some mind blowing facts about an another famous temple in Kerala.

I don’t like bragging in public but just to give you a glimpse and prove a small point here’s a yesterday’s revenueYes it’s just revenue - profit might be just Rs 50–60k but still that’s not bad right? After all to become a millionaire you just need to do 60–65L/mo revenues which is about what you see in the screenshot it’s indian Ecom and delivery rates are only about 56% which means the real revenues aren’t 4.3L but rather only 2.4–2.5L but even that translates to 70L-75L/mo which translates to over $1M/year To do this you just need to master Facebook ads and find a reliable partner like DOTS and which can handle everything else and you just run ads and drive sales! Now the problem is when you Google “Dropshipping” you start getting targeted by “gurus” on YouTube and Fb 😂Pay attention to the top most ad 😆 But what they won’t do is to teach you and give hands on help or training! C’mon recorded videos are SHIT you know it right? And in name of mentorship Ecom gurus are charging lakhs - some charge as high as $30000 🤬 But they’ll give you just 1–2 hours per week and to counter this I launched Ecom world university where you can ask as many doubts as you want - I mean it SERIOUSLY!I just finished a 6 hours+ long call yesterday and when something is not right I even give them a heads up like you see I told Gaurav! All you need to do is to 40–50 orders/day at AOV of Rs 1799–1899 which is our standard pricing point to be able to make more than $1000/day in revenues and $100/day profit at just 10% I know that won’t make you a millionaire but if you do the math you’d cross 2 lakhs/mo INR and still be able to live a comfortable life 😃 How much can you scale? We’ve sold over $2M in India and $7M+ globally - need I say more 😉,Om Thoke,https://www.quora.com/profile/Om-Thoke

It’s an unusual design but I trust in my Guru’s wisdom. The heart of the temple would be a rather empty small square room containing only one Murti a single square block of black stone waist-high carved with four images one on each side: Shiva Shakti Devi Ganesha and a serpent (representing Rahu as well as the Kundalini Shakti and Murugan). Invisibly this square block would be installed on top of a gold-leaf Sri Yantra completely covering it. Absolutely anyone of any gender caste or religion would be welcome to come and worship in the temple and would also be allowed to touch the Murti itself (particularly the feet of Shakti Devi). Daily pujas would be performed in the temple designed to keep the temple in pristine purity cultivate an atmosphere of pure devotion and kindle a sense of unity among the devotees. Some of the main pujas performed would be Shani Mangala and Rahu Shanti Pujas. The pujas would be done en masse guided by a trained pujari in which everyone of every caste religion age and gender joins in the pujas and performs the puja for themselves. Arati and abhisheka would also be performed to the murti (by trained priests) and it would be installed with Prana Pratishta. Only activities with direct spiritual bearing could ever be held in the temple premises. At festivals the Sri Lalita Sahasranama would be chanted five times daily in a call-and-response fashion to allow everyone to participate and in between other Divine Names would be chanted. Bhajans would be sung twice daily. Sannyasis brahmacharis and spiritually-minded devotees would be invited to give Satsang both in the morning and the evening. The exterior design would simply look like this:So that’s my Guru’s ideal design without reference to specific time place etc. However if I could construct a Hindu temple but it had to be in my own town where I live I would not want to make a new temple to compete with the main public one. We already have a good temple and I wouldn’t want to divide our Hindu community between two temples. In Hindu countries this can work (indeed many cities have dozens of temples) but here in diaspora there aren’t so many of us so we group together more. So instead what I would do is simply rebuild the current temple to be much nicer and I would follow the Panditji’s design. I expect that he would follow the traditional temple design of his ancient village near Hyderabad according to certain Shakta Agamas. In this I would defer to his expertise. Presumably there would be little or no change in which deities are worshipped inside it. So the list would be: Ganesha Shiva Durga (the main deity of the temple) Vishnu Lakshmi Krishna Radha Rama Sita Lakshmana Hanuman Saraswati Kurma Dattatreya Dhanvantari Venkateshwara Balaji Kartikeya Bala Tripurasundari Shirdi Sai Baba (debatably a deity but he is worshipped among them on the altar) Nandi and the Navagrahas. Actually many more deities are worshipped but those are the ones with specific Murtis on the altar. I don’t think it would be appropriate to construct a temple according to just my own personal devotional inclinations (in which case it would be primarily a Radha-Krishna temple). That’s what my own home puja room is for. A temple is for the wider Hindu community and should reflect the communal needs and preferences rather than just one person’s.,Devala Rees,https://www.quora.com/profile/Devala-Rees

Now the question arises when He is unborn how did He take birth which was mentioned in the verse BG 4.6 also. There seems to be Continue ReadingHare Krishna In Bhagavad Gita Lord Krishna says the following:“Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates and although I am the Lord of all sentient beings I still appear in every millennium in My transcendental form.” [BG 4.6] “He who knows Me as the unborn as the beginningless as the Supreme Lord of all the worlds-he undeluded among men is freed from all sins.” [BG 10.3]So from the above statements we can find Lord Krishna is unborn. Now the question arises when He is unborn how did He take birth which was mentioned in the verse BG 4.6 also. There seems to be an apparent contradiction. We need to understand this point deeply which even Krishna instructs in the following verse:“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not upon leaving the body take his birth again in this material world but attains My eternal abode O Arjuna.” [BG 4.9]From the above verse we can come to know Krishna’s birth rather the appearance is transcendental or divine unlike ours.The Lord was transferred from Vasudeva’s mind to Devaki’s mind and then Devali became pregnant. The following verse in Srimad Bhagavatam explained the event:“Thereafter accompanied by plenary expansions the fully opulent Supreme Personality of Godhead who is all-auspicious for the entire universe was transferred from the mind of Vasudeva to the mind of Devaki. Devaki having thus been initiated by Vasudeva became beautiful by carrying Lord Krsna the original consciousness for everyone the cause of all causes within the core of her heart just as the east becomes beautiful by carrying the rising moon.” [SB 10.2.18]So we can see Devaki didn’t become pregnant in normal way of intercourse. Hence Krishna’s birth is different from common people’s birth. Similarly Krishna didn’t come out of Devaki’s womb like any of us. In the Srimad Bhagavatam the event is mentioned:Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead Viṣṇu who is situated in the core of everyone’s heart appeared from the heart of Devakī in the dense darkness of night like the full moon rising on the eastern horizon because Devakī was of the same category as Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Vasudeva then saw the newborn child who had very wonderful lotuslike eyes and who bore in His four hands the four weapons śaṅkha cakra gadā and padma. On His chest was the mark of Śrīvatsa and on His neck the brilliant Kaustubha gem. Dressed in yellow His body blackish like a dense cloud His scattered hair fully grown and His helmet and earrings sparkling uncommonly with the valuable gem Vaidūrya the child decorated with a brilliant belt armlets bangles and other ornaments appeared very wonderful. [SB 10.3.8–10]So we can see Lord Krishna (Vishnu) directly came out of Devaki’s heart holding the 4 paraphernalia - conch discuss lotus and mace. Then later He transformed into a small child :..In their presence by His internal energy He then transformed Himself into a small human child. [SB 10.3.46]Therefore His appearance was different from ours as He did not appear by normal intercourse between a man and a woman nor came out of the mother’s womb in normal way but came out directly holding His weapons and other things. In fact in Mahabharata we can see many such characters who appeared in abnormal ways. For example the Pandavas and Karna were directly presented by their respective fathers like Indra Surya etc. to Kunti and Madri. The 100 Kauravas too were borne of pots (some compare this method with test tube babies). Dronacharya came out of a vessel directly. Jarasandha was born of 2 women and many such. In short not just Krishna even many devotees and demons also were born in abnormal way. Besides the appearance there are many other activities which provide Krishna is God. Consider the activities like lifting Govardhan mountain for 7 days continuously killing many demons right from His childhood expanding Himself to as many queens were there in Dwarika and serve them as husbands consuming the forest fires and many such.

Who is greatest among Brahma Vishnu and Mahesh and why?,https://www.quora.com/Who-is-greatest-among-Brahma-Vishnu-and-Mahesh-and-why,https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-18d216fce12cf915524b509973715bc6-lq,"Who is greatest among Brahma Vishnu and Mahesh?To learn about this answer you have to go way behind in time and learn about the origin. Let's start. Before the origin of this universe before the origin of Big Bang Theory way before the arrival of Milky Way Galaxy there was something known as “Point Zero”. Point Zero is something known as “Omkar” in Hindu culture. In point zero there was nothing no planets no universe no stars no celestial bodies nothing except for one big point of energy at the centre of nowhere like a vaccum. Now from that point zero aka Omkar Vishnu erupted. But his eyes were closed. He remained in that state for thousands of years. During the flow of time Brahma was erupted from the belly button of Vishnu. Again his eyes were closed too. They both floated for thousands of years. Finally a moment came and they collided with each other. Their eyes opened together at the same time. Brahma thought that Vishnu was created by him although Vishnu tried to convince him that he was born from Vishnu's belly button. They had a big argument about who erupted first and who was the greatest. Suddenly a voice came from the “Point Zero"" that was Omkar. The point started to grow bigger and bigger. It turned out into a big immeasurable “Linga"". From that Linga the voice said “I will decide who is the greatest and who came first. The first one who is able to measure me and find my end point shall be regarded as the greatest of all.” After listening to that both Brahma and Vishnu started measuring the Linga but towards the opposite direction of each other. After traveling on the path of Linga for thousands of years Vishnu realised that it was infinite there was no end to it. The Linga will never end. However Brahma created an object that had voice in it and that said this is the end. Brahma stopped and went to meet Vishnu. Vishnu asked Brahma if he has found the end point of the Linga. Brahma told yes and showed him the object that he created and told that that object was the end of Linga. The moment he said that a voice came from Linga that was formed from point zero Omkar. It said “this is wrong. Brahma you are wrong.” Suddenly the Linga collapsed and formed into Shiva the point zero or Omkar was formed into Lord Shiva. He said Brahma was wrong and Brahma was formed from the belly button of Vishnu and he was the one who created Vishnu. He asked Vishnu about what he's got. Vishnu said that the Linga is infinite and there's no end to it. Shiva was impressed by the knowledge of Vishnu. He revealed that he himself was indeed the point zero and Omkar. He also revealed again that Vishnu was formed by his energy of Shiva and from the energy of Vishnu Brahma was formed. Shiva gave the boon to Vishnu that Vishnu shall be worshipped regardless of any Avatar he forms. But due to the ego of Brahma to prove himself as the superior one Brahma shall never be worshipped. Still he gave the power of creation to Brahma because Brahma was able to create the object that produced the sound. So Shiva gave the power of creation to Brahma the power of protection to Vishnu and he himself became the destroyer if anybody crosses the line and breaks his Dharma Shiva shall destroy. That's how all three were formed Shiva from the Omkar aka point zero Vishnu from the energy of Shiva and Brahma from the energy of belly button of Vishnu. All three of them are related to each other. One more story after the creation of this universe by Brahma all three of them decided to test their abilities. So the first test was for Brahma if he could take the energy of the remaining two. Both Vishnu and Shiva used their energies to destroy Brahma. Brahma was burnt into ashes due to the energy produced by Shiva and Vishnu. But Brahma was reformed from those ashes. Then Brahma and Shiva burnt Vishnu using their energies. And Vishnu was reformed from the ashes. Lastly both Vishnu and Brahma used their energies to burn Shiva into Ashes. Shiva was formed again. From that moment it was concluded that there's no greatest among three. All three of them were equal parts of each other. They cannot be destroyed. One last story to convince you when Adi Shakti the other part of Shiva took birth on Earth in the form of human body known as Shati it was essential for her to marry Shiva to get into her deity form. But Shiva was a deity not a human and Shati was half human half deity. At first Shiva denied marrying Sati. But after many attempts he agreed and finally married Sati. However Prajapati Daksh the son of Brahma who was a scholar at the time was the father of Sati and he hated Shiva. He never worshipped Shiva as a deity. One day after the marriage of Shiva Daksh decided to have a yagna. His other daughter went to invite Shati and Shiva. But Shiva was punishing Shati at the time because she misused her powers to time travel and test Shree Ram in the future. Shati changed her looks to appear like Sita. She went to Ram who immediately identified her as Adi Shakti and bowed before her. However Shiva didn't liked that move from Shati and isolated her because Shiva worshipped Sita. After the incident Shati promised her sister to bring Shiva to the yagna. But Shiva denied to go. So Shati went alone. By the moment she reached the palace of Daksh her sister who invited her was already forbidden from the palace due to inviting her and Shiva without consulting her father Daksh. The guards stopped Shati at the gate and told her she cannot take Nandi and other colleagues inside. When she went inside Daksh insulted her and Shiva to the limits. Shati lost her cool and vowed to burn herself in that hawan kund of yagna so that the ritual never becomes successful. As she sat on fire it didn't burn as the energy of fire was not able to burn her body. After witnessing her failed attempt Daksh got more furious and insulted Shiva and Shati more. When the water flew over the head Shati finally turned into full form of Adi Shakti who was just another part of Shiva. She used her own energy to burn her human body till death since was still in a human form and not a deity form her human part would still die. When Shiva realised that Shati burnt herself Shiva raged. He wanted to punish Prajapati Daksh and destroy everything in his path. He pulled out a few portion of his hair and formed his powerful version of Veer Bhadra from that hair. He ordered Bhadra to destroy everybody until Daksh is announced dead. Bhadra started killing all the armies of Daksha with Earth shaking powers. Not even the Gods were able to stop Bhadra. Daksha called Vishnu out of fear who had promised to protect him. To fulfill his promise Vishnu appeared before Bhadra and threw an electric force to prevent Bhadra from moving. After witnessing that the anger of Shiva reached it's peak. He pulled another hair from his head and formed Bhadra Kali. She was just another version of Shiva made for destruction only. Bhadra Kali entered the body of Veer Bhadra. As she got mixed with Veer Bhadra Bhadra was able to break the barricades of electric forces created by Vishnu. He destroyed the entire Narayani Sena of Vishnu. The only last option left for Vishnu to stop Veer Bhadra was to use to the Sudarshan Chakra. Daksha Prajapati asked Vishnu to use the Sudarshan Chakra to protect him. Vishnu told Daksha that he has successfully fulfilled his promise to protect Daksha. But he never promised to protect Daksh's life. He told Daksh that if his Sudarshan Chakra collides with Veer Bhadra and Bhadra Kali it would produce an enormous energy that would not only destroy the nine planets but the entire Solar System and the creation of Brahma as well because just like Sudarshan Chakra were the ultimate weapon of Vishnu Bhadra Kali and Veer Bhadra were the ultimate weapon of Shiva. To prevent the destruction of the universe Vishnu escaped out of the scene towards Baikunth. Finally Daksha was left alone and couldn't face the wrath of Veer Bhadra. He was finally killed after Vishnu failed to protect him and refused to use the nuclear Sudarshan Chakra. All these stories from Vishnu and Shiv Puranas tell us that all three deities are parts of one another. All of them cannot be destroyed and should never be compared. Only a fool will compare them because Vishnu respects and worships Shiva. Shiva respects and worships Vishnu. They both are acknowledged by Brahma and independent of each other who have their own roles to either create protect or destroy this universe. So the conclusion is that never compare the Trimurti. All three of them are greatest. Only a fool with ego problem like Prajapati Daksh will compare their powers. Hope this helps you.",Anamika Sharma,https://www.quora.com/profile/Anamika-Sharma-1137

As such Shri Ram had no reason to attack Lanka kill unaccountable people and then ‘forcibly’ bring Sita back.  Lot of confusion has been created regarding the role of Shri Ram in Agni Pariksha of Sita. The question still remains to be answered whether Shri Ram supported or opposed Agni Pariksha.  Returning back to Ayodhya after killing Ravana Ram was coroneted as king of Ayodhya. Shri Ram was the king who had inherited the throne of great King Dasrath which was subsequently and ably ruled by Bharat on behalf of Shri Ram. They had an efficient system of obtaining feedback from the public on the basis of which laws were made for the welfare of the public  And now King Ram was receiving these feedbacks. Some of these feedbacks were very disturbing. They were all about Sita and how she could not be accepted back as queen after staying with Ravan. Initially these feedbacks were ignored. Slowly these feedbacks started increasing and dissatisfaction became much more apparent. Something had to be done.  But Ram is not called Maryada Purushottam just as a mark of respect. He always respected the existing tradition (Maryada) of that time. Shri Rama respected the citizens. He respected the people's talks. He declared that Sita had to pass the Agni Pariksha test so that he could accept her back. Laxman strongly opposed this. Yet the victorious army chief insisted that Agni Pariksha was the only thing which could make him accept her. Sita agreed and after the satisfactory completion of the ritual ‘Agni Pariksha’ Shri Ram gladly accepted her back as his wife.  Ram did it not because he personally doubted Sita but because of the demands of his dharma as a king; he knew she was innocent but he had to show his praja (subject) that unlike his father he was not a slave to a woman that as a just raja he was willing to make any amount of personal sacrifices for them. It was an act of sacrifice for him as well. He suffered no less and lived an ascetic life thereafter.  Our king might accept a wife who had stayed in another man’s home but not me – On hearing a washer man question the purity of the Queen of Ayodhya Lord Ram decides to send a pregnant Mata Sita to the forest. Rama is the ideal king and for a modern reader this is heights of stupidity and absurdity. A modern reader would want Lord Ram to stand by his wife and defend her and not to fall for the irresponsible prattle of his foolish subjects.  If Lord Ram had sent the washer man questioning the purity of Mata Sita to prison he would be performing the duty of a husband. But will he be performing the duty of a King? Lord Ram could have beheaded the washer man on the spot. But will he be able behead all those people that questions the purity of Mata Sita. Lord Ram would have become a dictator! Would we worship such a Lord Ram today? Hence Shri Rama never doubted Sita.,Jaydeep Parmar,https://www.quora.com/profile/Jaydeep-Parmar-8

Although it is said that it started just after the return of Sri Krishna to Vaikuntha this Yuga kept its first step on Earth on the ninth day of the Mahabharata War.

Pre-informed about Kali Parikshit decided to stop him who was entering his kingdom along with his weapons of treachery lust greed and evil. The King hunted the demon until the latter surrendered and explained him the rules of Brahma. Kaliyuga began to pray –kalir uvācayatra kva vātha vatsyāmisārva-bhauma tavājñayālakṣaye tatra tatrāpitvām ātteṣu-śarāsanamtan me dharma-bhṛtāṁ śreṣṭhasthānaṁ nirdeṣṭum arhasiyatraiva niyato vatsyaātiṣṭhaṁs te ‘nuśāsanamO Your Majesty though I may live anywhere and everywhere under your order I shall but see you with bow and arrows wherever I look.

Slaughter house- Weapon of Evil You must reside in this place where humans leave behind their humanity and reveal the evil inside them and butcher innocent animals and humans. 4. Gambling areas- Weapon of treachery Those who come here are prepared to gamble their lives away; therefore you have the authority to destroy their life. 5. Gold- Weapon of Greed Hearing this Kali Yuga said “O king all those who come to these 5 places are bad men already but how shall I demolish the good ones as my weapon of Greed would remain unused.” King Parikshit then allowed him one place where he can use the weapon of Greed and that was Gold. Kali Yuga knew that he had acquired the entire world but Parikshit’s Kingdom and until he was alive this wouldn’t be possible. Therefore in order to do so he must enter his crown that was made of Gold.

In the plants and lower species there is rudimentary consciousness which is greatly contracted as species evolve the consciousness also evolves and expands as the concept of Self also develops and becomes more pronounced the ability to make informed decisions also evolves. Some animals have a very good concept of Self and humans of course are the most evolved creatures on the planet.

Photos of Lepakshi Temple Read More on Lepakshi Temple About the Place Legend and History The origination of name Lepakshi has two myths associated with it. According to the first legend Lepakshi found its roots in the legendary Ramayana when Ravana had kidnapped Sita. As he was taking her away the bird Jataya tried saving her from his hand. Defeated by Ravana he fell on the floor. As he was counting his last breathe Lord Rama helped him attain Moksha by saying 'Le Pakshi' which in Telugu means 'Rise Bird.' Hence the name Lepakshi originated. According to another legend there were two brothers in the Vijayanagar Kingdom - Virupanna and Veerupanna. Virupanna's son was blind and it is said that he gained sightedness while he was playing around the Shivalinga in the temple. Veerupanna was one of the financiers of Vijayanagar. Blamed by others for using the royal treasury; some say for the completion of the temple while some say for curing his son the king gave orders for taking off his eyes. Disturbed by the false accusation he forestalled the punishment and threw his eyes onto the walls of the temple. Hence the place got its name Lape-Akshi meaning the village of the blinded. Now the eerie part is that the temple wall still has the blood marks of the eyes.

Of course the idea of “species” and melanistic cats (black coat) was not understood at the time. So using the best zoological knowledge available the Leopard was thought to be the result of black panthers mating with lions. And so it was for some time. Makes sense to me! So how did a lion mating with a black panther come to be known as “Leopard”? For that we have to refer to more ancient times of Latin and Greek. The Greeks named the large maned African cat “leon”. At the same time the black panther was also named. It was named “pardos”. This name in turn is said to come from the Sanskrit “prdakuh"". So we have the lion “leon” mating with the panther “pardos” and we get “leo-pardos” or “leopardus”.

Astrologers skip a 13th constellation that also resides on the ecliptic: Ophiuchus. Babylonian astrologers and later the Greeks originally determined Zodiac signs by which constellation the sun was ""in"" on the day you were born. Early astronomers observed the sun traveling through the signs of the Zodiac in the course of one year spending about a month in each. Thus they calculated that each constellation extends 30 degrees across the ecliptic. Ancient astrologers grouped the 12 signs according to the classical elements. The elements represent personality traits and are used in conjunction with the star signs as well as with the position of the sun moon and known planets at the time to determine a horoscope. Fire — Aries Sagittarius Leo (spontaneous and impulsive) Water — Cancer Scorpio Pisces (imaginative and emotional) Air — Libra Aquarius Gemini (quick and animated tendency to intellectualize feelings) Earth — Capricorn Taurus Virgo (quiet and slow reactions slow to change emotionally) However a phenomenon called precession has altered the position of the constellations we see today and has resulted in a shift of the zodiac constellations. Precession and astrology The first day of spring in the Northern Hemisphere was once marked by the zero point of the Zodiac. Astronomers call this the vernal equinox and it occurs as the ecliptic and celestial equator intersect on approximately March 21. Around 600 B.C. the zero point was in Aries and was called the ""first point of Aries."" The constellation Aries encompassed the first 30 degrees of the ecliptic; from 30 to 60 degrees was Taurus; from 60 to 90 degrees was Gemini; and so on for all 12 constellations of the Zodiac. Unbeknownst to the ancient astrologers Earth continually wobbles around its axis in a 25800-year cycle. This wobble — called precession — is caused by the gravitational attraction of the moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. Over the past two-and-a-half millennia this wobble has caused the intersection point between the celestial equator and the ecliptic to move west along the ecliptic by 36 degrees or almost exactly one-tenth of the way around to the border of Pisces and Aquarius. This means that the signs have slipped one-tenth — or almost one whole month — of the way around the sky to the west relative to the stars beyond. For instance those born between March 21 and April 19 consider themselves to be Aries. Today the sun is no longer within the constellation of Aries during much of that period. From March 11 to April 18 the sun is actually in the constellation of Pisces! Wobbly Earth Means Your Horoscope Is Wrong",Alan Low,https://www.quora.com/profile/Alan-Low-4

What left of the ancient empire were sacked captured and raided several times by the various emerging powers of the region (but most notably by the Kingdom of Ayuttaya.) The threat from foreign power was so bad that the remains of the Khmer nobles and royalties were forced to abandon Angkor altogether. As they formed the new kingdom based on the modern day Phnom Penh their main rival the Ayuttayan also lost the incentive to occupy the city altogeher. Thus the ruin of Angkor was left to be reclaimed by nature and was never discover again prior to the arrival of the French during the Indochina period.,Suttichart Denpreuktham,https://www.quora.com/profile/Suttichart-The-Cat

The extent of the determination to sacrifice wealth for the sake of God is one important angle. Another important angle is the recognition of human form of God who enjoys your sacrifice. You might have reached the climax of the first angle. In such case you sacrifice your wealth to temples but not to human incarnation which will be properly utilized by Him. The wealth sacrificed by you to the temples is not properly utilized by the people of management of the temple. They distribute the food among all the devotees who visit the temple. Such sacrifice is totally waste. You must differentiate the poor devotees and help them by such donated wealth. You can help even an atheist who is a poor person. If the atheist becomes free of the worries of the poverty he will have peaceful mind to think about God and in course of time he may become a great devotee of God. You are helping him by providing a chance to become the devotee of God. Therefore the management of temple should spend the devoted wealth to help the poor people and not to help the rich devotees who are not in need. The service is being done to all the devotees irrespective of their need. This lack of discrimination is the greatest sin in view of God. Therefore the donor himself should do such service by spending some time in such important effort. This will be far better than the blind donation to some agency which itself is blind. You must help the poor people irrespective of their devotion because even an atheist has chance to become a devotee after becoming peaceful in mind. Practice is equally important The extent of the determination to sacrifice wealth for the sake of God is one important angle. Another important angle is the recognition of human form of God who enjoys your sacrifice. The people who are not matured in either of these two angles neither like the sacrifice nor like the recognition of human incarnation. They become very intelligent and like to have the fruit of sacrifice of both the angles through their clever interpretation. They treat the statue or photo as God. They sacrifice the food to God represented by photo or statue and eat it. They claim to achieve the fruit of the devotee sacrificing the food to human incarnation. Statues and photos are the results of the clever interpretations of such selfish people only. If such angle is not present in the mind the offer of food to the statues and photos is not at all wrong because such sacrifice develops at least the theoretical devotion in the beginners. Theory is the mother of practice. Without theory there is no birth of practice. But the theory without practice is a waste in the long run and does not yield even a trace of the fruit at anytime. The knowledge and devotion are the two parts of the theory. You may have lot of information about Delhi and its path and you many have a lot of inspiration also to go to Delhi. Both these are knowledge and devotion respectively. Without putting even a little effort like going to the railway station to purchase the ticket there is no use of the knowledge and the devotion. Theory is very important because it is the generator of the practice. But practice is equally important since there will be no generation of even a trace of fruit without practice. Therefore the theory involving jnana yoga (knowledge) and bhakti yoga (devotion) along with karma yoga (practice) are equally needed for achieving the grace of God.,Shri Datta,https://www.quora.com/profile/Shri-Datta-6

Pashupatinath TempleDedicated to Lord Shiva Pashupatinath is one of the four most important religious sites in Asia for devotees of Shiva. Built in the 5th century and later renovated by Malla kings the site itself is said to have existed from the beginning of the millennium when a Shiva lingam was discovered here. The largest temple complex in Nepal it stretches on both sides of the Bagmati River which is considered holy by Hindus. The main pagoda style temple has a gilded roof four sides covered in silver and exquisite wood carvings. Temples dedicated to several other Hindu and Buddhist deities surround the the temple of Pashupatinath. 2. Manakamana TempleManakamana Temple Tour is a famous tour among the Hindus because it takes them to Manakamana Devi who is a goddess that will fulfill their wishes. Many devotees have their wishes fulfilled by her. Manakamana is not only her name; it is the name of a place. Manakamana is a holy place centrally located to which the devotees from the northern side western side and eastern side head off to be blessed to be protected and to pray that their wishes would be fulfilled in the upcoming days. 3. Dantakali TempleLocated in the middle of the Vijaypur Hill in Dharan the Dantakali temple is said to be founded on the spot where Sati Devi’s teeth fell. According to legend Sati Devi was the consort of Lord Shiva who was so bereaved upon her death that he carried her dead body and wandered aimlessly around the earth. The temple in its present form was built by locals after 1978 AD and consists of a cement and brick structure with three roofs and a metal pinnacle on the top. Housed within the temple is the actual object of worship — a silver-plated rock in the shape of teeth which are said to Sati Devi’s. 4. Dakshinkali TempleThe Dakshinkali Temple is one of the well-known Hindu enshrinement that is devoted to the Goddess Kali also known as “the black one”. The Dakshinkali Temple can be found 22 kilometers from Kathmandu valley and about a kilometer from the village known as Pharping. While the road to the DakshinKali Temple is in very good condition it is a steep climb all the way. Anyone planning to get to the DakshinKali Temple will find the incline quite interesting and the fun part will be on the way back. The DakshinKali Temple is about 45 minutes by taxi from Kathmandu although there is the availability of public transport; this is not the best way to get to DakshinKali Temple because this kind of transport is usually quite packed. 5. Changunarayan TempleChangunarayan Temple is one of the most religious cultural artistic and historical temple. The temple is located on the high hilltop. This also known as Changu or Dolagiri. It is about 12 km east of Kathmandu and about 6 km north of Bhaktapur. This temple is surrounded by champak tree forest. Changunarayan is another name of the god Vishnu.

RelatedWhat is the service of a Hindu temple?,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-service-of-a-Hindu-temple?no_redirect=1,,I’m assuming you mean “service” in the sense of public ceremonial worship the way it’s used in Christianity though I’ve never heard the term used that way by Hindus. There are usually no sermons or talks by a priest. It can vary widely from temple to temple and even from day to day within a temple. The most common form of worship in most Hindu temples is Puja. The priest(s) perform Puja several times throughout the day at specific times. It generally involves ringing bells passing a flame before the Murtis (ritually enlivened idols) of the Gods chanting mantras making offerings (mainly of water and certain foods) and performing various other ritual actions. Worshippers may come to give thanks to the Divine to ask for assistance to perform penance to contemplate; but most of all to experience the Darshan of the Gods. Darshan literally means sight but it conveys much more. The worshipper makes eye contact with the deity and intensely feels the deity seeing them back like eye contact with a living person. In Darshan one imbibes the energy of the deity and receives blessings. It doesn’t even strictly require eye contact; blind Hindus still speak of “getting Darshan” for example. It’s just a close intimate communion with the deity. The priest mainly assists by fully waking the Murtis and calling their attention so that worshippers may come and have their Darshan. Most offerings are also made by the priest since technical methods and purity requirements usually apply. Sometimes individuals or family groups have specific rituals performed for them at Hindu temples. There is a huge variety of such rituals. Also special Pujas occur on specific days and festivities happen in Hindu temples on the great festival days. There are also other more elaborate rituals such as Homas (also called Yagnyas or Havanas) involving large fire sacrifices. Usually fewer people are allowed to attend these. Essentially Hindu temples serve as dwelling places for deities so that worshippers may come and worship them there with the aid of specialists.,Devala Rees,https://www.quora.com/profile/Devala-Rees

While these religions are all based on the common framework of Shruti Smriti and Samhita individual rosters of scriptures vary widely. This is why it is plainly erroneous to judge the attitude of the 'Hindu' purely by studying the mythology. (This is also why I did not merge this question with What are your views on the women's role in the Indian mythology? which I've already answered.) That said I'd like to make one important observation about the treatment of women in 'Hinduism' viz. A lot of people claim that because we worship female deities and consider all women as aspects of Devi Hinduism is automatically female-friendly. This idea is patently false. Let's take the supposedly ""most celebrated passage about women"" from the Markandeya Purana.Vidyah samastastava Devi vedahStriyah samasta sakala Jagatsu (Chandi XI.6) All lores are your aspects O Devi; Likewise are all women in the world (your aspects) endowed with various attributes.This verse is a textbook example of benevolent sexism and positive stereotyping of underprivileged categories. As many studies (such as The insidious (and ironic) effects of positive stereotypes and The Pain of Positive Stereotypes) have shown and I quote: (positive stereotypes of underprivileged categories) are at once both especially unlikely to arouse skepticism and emotional vigilance while also especially likely to produce antiquated and harmful beliefs towards members of the target  group (compared to both baseline conditions and exposure to negative  stereotypes) including beliefs in the biological (or “natural”)  underpinnings of group differences and ironically the application of  negative stereotypes.Or in simpler words positive stereotypes tend to be more readily accepted and ultimately lead to the propagation of negative stereotypes. As another author has opined: positive stereotypes strip people of their individuality and alienate  them for not meeting the standards that are imposed upon themEven when individual women are praised and worshipped practically all the praise given is of the ""You Are a Credit to Your Race"" and ""Madonna-Whore Complex"" variety.  In the examples quoted by Pradip Gangopadhyay below every single example is built on the assumption that All Women Are Lustful. The lady who wants to remain a woman does so because sexual intercourse is more pleasurable in the female body. The woman who claims to be her own mistress appears to Ashtavakra in the guise of a old but lustful woman who saysThe very deities of wind and fire and water or the other celestials O  regenerate one are not so agreeable to women as the deity of desire.  Verily women are exceedingly fond of sexual congress. Among a thousand  women or perhaps among hundreds of thousands sometimes only one may  be found that is devoted to her husband. When under the influence of  desire they care not for family or father or mother or brother or  husband or sons or husband's brother (but pursue the way that desire  points out). Verily in pursuit of what they consider happiness they  destroy the family (to which they belong by birth or marriage) even as  many queenly rivers eat away the banks that contain them. The Creator  himself had said this quickly marking the faults of women.The Pingala alluded to is a courtesan who ""liberates"" herself by abandoning her legitimate profession (and possibly starving in the process). The Sulabha spoken of is an exception not the rule. Sure all of these may be construed as praise for the individual women but it is given at the expense of an entire gender. As I've mentioned elsewhere every  outspoken heroine from Sita in the Ramayana to the Devi in the Devi  Bhagawata Purana uninamously says the same thing: ""I'm not like the  common woman (प्राकृता). How dare you compare me to the common woman?  Quelle horreur!"" Truth is whether we portray women as being ""more than human"" or ""less than human"" we are essentially saying that they are ""not human"". If anything the religions under the umbrella of Hinduism are more guilty of sexism due to their insistence on Devi worship.",Ishita Roy,https://www.quora.com/profile/Ishita-Roy-9

However  sometimes he is praised as superior to Rudra in Mahabharata. Brahma is the most praised diety in Valmiki Ramayana. He was belittled by sectarians in Puranas .Credits to Vlad - The Impaler In this chapter of Mahabharata Brahma pcreates and effortlessly destroyed the universe which was without decay and later created the concept of death on Shiva's request.In the beginning the Grandsire Brahma created all creatures. Endued with mighty energy he saw that the creation bore no signs of decay. Thereat O king the Creator began to think about the destruction of the universe. Reflecting on the matter O monarch the Creator failed to find any means of destruction. He then became angry and in consequence of his anger a fire sprang from the sky. That fire spread in all directions for consuming everything of the universe. Then heaven sky and earth all became filled with fire. And thus the Creator began to consume the whole mobile and immobile universe. Thereby all creatures mobile and immobile were destroyed.Indeed the mighty Brahma frightening everything by the force of his wrath did all this Then Hara otherwise called Sthanu or Siva with matted locks on his head that Lord of all wanderers of the night appealed to the divine Brahma the Lord of the gods. When Sthanu fell at Brahma's feet from a desire of doing good to all creatures the Supreme Deity to that greatest of ascetics blazing with splendour said What wish of thine shall we accomplish O thou that deservest to have all thy wishes fulfilled? O thou that hast been born of our wish! We shall do all that may be agreeable to thee! Tell us O Sthanu what is thy wish.Sthanu said O lord thou hadst taken great care for creating diverse creatures. Indeed creatures of diverse kinds were created and reared by thee. Those very creatures again are now being consumed through thy fire. Seeing this I am filled with compassion. O illustrious lord be inclined to grace 'Brahma said I had no desire of destroying the universe I desired good of the earth and it was for this that wrath possessed me. The goddess Earth afflicted with the heavy weight of creatures always urged me for destroying the creatures on her. Urged by her I could not however find any means for the destruction of the infinite creation. At this wrath possessed me' Rudra said Be inclined to grace. O lord of the universe cherish not th creatures with their productive powers weakened be exterminated.O Creator of the worlds thou hast appointed me their Protector O Lord of the universe let not the mobile and the immobile universe to be destroyed. Thou art inclined to grace and it is for this that I say these words unto thee' Narada continued Hearing these words of Mahadeva the divine Brahma from desire of benefiting creatures held in his own inner self his wrath that had been roused. Extinguishing the fire the divine Benefactor of the world the great Master declared the duties of Production and Emancipation. And while the Supreme Deity exterminated that fire born of his wrath there came out from the doors of his diverse senses a female who was dark and red and tawny whose tongue and face and eyes were red and who was decked with two brilliant ear-rings and diverse other brilliant ornaments. Issuing out of his body she smilingly looked at those two lords of the universe and then set out for the southern quarter Then Brahma that controller of the creation and destruction of the worlds called after her by the name of Death. And Brahma O king said unto her Slay these creatures of mine! Thou hast been born of that wrath of mine which I cherished for the destruction of the universe. By doing this kill all creatures including idiots and seers at my command. By doing this thou wilt be benefitted have accomplished everything O holy one that thou hadst ordered us to do in the matter of afflicting the foes of celestials. The Deity having the bull for his mark has been gratified with us. A car hath been constructed by us equipped with many wonderful weapons. We do not however know who is to become the driver of that foremost of cars. Therefore let some foremost one among the gods be appointed as the driver. O holy one it behoveth thee to make true those words that thou O lord hadst then said to us.Drona parva section 62 and 63 Karna parva chap 34.Duryodhana said Even thus did that illustrious Deity that Grandsire of all the worlds viz Brahman act as driver on that occasion and even thus did Rudra become the warrior. The driver of the car O hero should be superior to the warrior on it. Therefore O tiger among men do thou hold the reins of the steeds in this battle. As on that occasion the Grandsire had been selected with care by all the celestials indeed O great king as one greater than Sankara so thou that art superior to Karna art now selected by us with care.

In ancient temples ( which are protected by Government) they may not allow you to carry your mobiles and cameras inside the temple as taking snaps is prohibited. You have to surrender the said things at the entrance and collect your token. There are dress code in some temples. It is better to implicitly follow the prescribed and time-tested dress code instead of arguing with the temple authorities and spoil one’s mood. Better wear simple but clean clothes. People are prone to display vulgarly their richness by wearing costly and gaudy clothes and jewellery. In a temple God should be the cynosure and not humans. Inside the temple one should maintain pin-drop silence. One should hear only the bellring and sounds of other sacred instruments installed in a temple as also the recital of Mantras by the priests. One should go to temples to receive positive energy and blessings and not disturb the temple atmosphere by our constant chatter and garish attire. Forget not to tip the priests as they will be usually from poor background and they will be acting as agents to pray God on your behalf by reciting sacred and relevant Mantras. Put some money in the Hundi (cash box) which will be utilised for providing further amenities to the devotees. Last but not the least it is not the things which you carry to a temple that matters. What matters is your childlike innocence and the belief that their exists a supreme power (whom we call God) which is so perfectly handling the proceedings of this universe.,V.S.

Rig Yajur and Sama. Rig Veda is the first one and the other two are based on the Rig Veda. Yajur Veda describes the procedures of Yajnas of the Rig Veda. The real Yajnas happen in the celestial space not on our earth! The Srauta Yajnas of the Yajur Veda are the exact duplication of the Creation of a galaxy. Sama Veda is the same Rig Veda chanted in a poetic way. Atharva Veda is not considered as the fourth Veda as it doesn't have much in common with the Rig Veda.

RelatedHow old is Earth according to Indians?,https://www.quora.com/How-old-is-Earth-according-to-Indians?no_redirect=1,,Surya Siddhantham (सूर्य सिद्धान्तं) is one of the most important texts that demonstrate how great and advanced the ancient Indian sciences are. The author of this book is unknown and it is said to be apaurusheya (अपौरुषेय) which means that it was not created by any human. Several interesting astronomical concepts such as determining the planetary positions the time of eclipses etc. are clearly described in this. The diameter of earth was described to be 16001600 Yojana (1600×8=128001600×8=12800 km). This value differs just 0.3% by the value calculated by today’s scientists. This error too may be because of taking Yojana as 8 kilometers which might be an approximation. The formula to find the area of circle was also provided as the square root of 10 multiplied by the diameter. (Today we use 𝜋π instead of 10‾‾‾√10. And 10‾‾‾√=3.16≈𝜋10=3.16≈π) So I am taking this great book as reference for my answer to this question. The following are some conversions of time according to this book. 11 Solar Year = 11 Divine Day360360 Divine days (or) 360360 Solar Years = 11 Divine Year1200012000 Divine Years = 11 Maha Yuga Maha Yuga is subdivided into 4 yugas in the ratio 4:3:2:1. The names and duration of each of these yuga are as given below. Satya Yuga = 48004800 Divine Years (0.40.4 Maha Yuga)Treta Yuga = 36003600 Divine Years (0.30.3 Maha Yuga)Dwapara Yuga = 24002400 Divine Years (0.20.2 Maha Yuga)Kali Yuga = 12001200 Divine Years (0.10.1 Maha Yuga) 7171 Maha Yuga are equivalent to 11 Manvantara. And in between every two Manvantaras there is a Manu Sandhi which is equivalent to Satya Yuga. 1414 Manvantaras along with the Sandhis form a Kalpa. There will be 1515 Manusandhis in a Kalpa which include 1313 in between 1414 Manvantaras 11 in the beginning and 11 in the ending. 11 Kalpa = 1414 Manvantaras ++ 1515 Sandhis = 14×71+15×0.414×71+15×0.4 Maha Yugas 11 Kalpa = 10001000 Maha Yugas Life span of Brahma (The creator): 11 Kalpa is equivalent to 11 day (or 11 night) to Brahma and Brahma has a life span of 100100 years of which each year has 360360 days and 360360 nights. Life span of Brahma = 100×360×2100×360×2 Kalpas= 100×360×2×1000100×360×2×1000 Maha Yugas= 7200000072000000 Maha Yugas Brahma’s present age: As of now 5050 Brahma years have been passed and of the 51𝑠𝑡51st year the first day is currently going on. As each day of Brahma is equivalent to 11 Kalpa this is the first Kalpa in the 51𝑠𝑡51st year. Out of the 1414 Manvantaras of this Kalpa 66 have lapsed and we are now in the 7𝑡ℎ7th Manvantara. Out of the 7171 Maha Yuga of this Manvantara 2727 have been passed and the present one is the 28𝑡ℎ28th. In this 28𝑡ℎ28th Maha Yuga the first 33 Yugas are over and this is the Kali Yuga.

Being largely descended from Brahmins Hindu law permits them to wear the sacred thread perform various priestly duties and accords them a position equal to that of Brahmins.

They are Manu (blacksmith) Maya (carpenter) Thwastha (metal craftsman) Silpi (stone-carver) Vishvajnya (goldsmith). The community is spread widely throughout India and played a vital role in the village economy. Their socio-economic status varied from a very high level to the low level in different parts of India as they earned high wages in towns because of their factory employment and low in villages. Lord Vishwakarma Vishvakarma is the Hindu presiding deity of all craftsmen and architects. In Hindu mythology Viswakarma is considered as the Divine Architect. He is called 'Devashilpi' or 'The Architect of Gods'. He is the ""Principal Universal Architect"" the architect who fabricated and designed the divine architecture of the Universe at the behest of Brahma the Lord of Creation. The Rig Veda describes Viswakarma as the god with multi-dimensional vision and supreme strength. He is able to predict well in advance in which direction his creation will move. Hindus worship Lord Vishwakarma as the god of engineering and architecture. As explained above the Dhimans are basically craftsman communities in recent times due to their ability of Good craftsmanship they were engaged in Royal Army's weapon factories In this way they were conccected with Sikh Gurus  Who had appointed them their major Architect in weapon development and innovations  working day and night with Gurus they gradually inclined with Sikhism but after becoming Sikhs they haven't forgotten their old customs even today on Vishkarma day  they perform Puja and keep their tool clean with water mix milk and distribute Parsad to All.

He got his name from his head which was shaped like a pot (in Sanskrit Ghatam means pot and ""Utkach"" means head. His wife was Ahilawati Ghatotkacha is the father of Barbarika Anjanaparvan Meghavarna. Only Anjanaparvan participated in the war. They were the grandsons of Bhima. In the war Anjanaparvan did not wear armor because his chest was stronger than the arrows which would break into pieces on hitting his body. Barbarik is probably the strongest warrior in Mahabharata who can finish the war in 1 minute. That’s why Krishna asks for his head in charity so that he is not able to participate in the war.

And since this knowledge was more important for mankind it got written more clearly as just Bhagvad Gita and was passed on further from generation to generation through our saints and preachers in hinduism. Later this was turned into a spiritual revolution by “Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada” in the 19th century bringing the Bhagvad Gita into the hands of common people. And many people out of which someone like me also were being able to ingest this Gyan. For me I will say I have just ingested a part but still a drop from the ocean means a lot too.

Who judges a Hindu? How is he/she judged after death?,https://www.quora.com/Who-judges-a-Hindu-How-is-he-she-judged-after-death,,There are two major views of the afterlife in Hinduism. The mythical and the philosophical. Huge topic but I shall be as brief as possible. Firstly the Philosophical - each individual consists of 3 bodies: physical body comprise of 70% water and some bio-matter (sthūla śarīra) an energetic/psychic/mental/subtle body (sūkṣma-śarīra) and a causal body (kāraṇa śarīra) comprising all our subliminal stuff i.e. mental impressions etc. Thus the individual is a stream of consciousness which flows through all the physical changes of the body and at the death of the physical body flows on into another physical body. The two components that transmigrate are the subtle body and the causal body. The thought that occupies the mind at the time of death determines the quality of our rebirth (antim smaraṇa) _ hence the need to be mindful of our thoughts and the need to cultivate positive wholesome thoughts - mantra chanting is an aid to this. The Mythical - includes the philosophical but adds colour panache and dramatic narrative and effect. When we leave the physical body at death we appear in the court of Lord Yama the God of Death for an exit interview. The panel consists of Yama and Chitragupta - the cosmic accountant and Varuna the cosmic intelligence officer. We are counseled about our life achievements and failures and are shown a mirror in which our entire life is reflected. (Important to note that philosophically these three gentlemen are projections of our own mind.) Yama the Lord of Dharma and Justice then sends us to a heavenly holiday realm (svarga) if we have been exceptionally benevolent and beneficent for a period of Rest and Recreation. Our vacation is limited in time by the weight of our good deeds. If we have been exceptionally malevolent and caused immense suffering to other beings then we are sent to a cosmic gulag (naraka) to fast-track our negative Karma - again limited by the enormity of our wickedness. The vast majority of people are neither very good or very wicked - they are mediocre so they take rebirth almost immediately according to Karma. Very important to note neither heaven nor hell are permanent states in Hindu Jain and Buddhist belief systems. After we have exhausted our benevolence and malevolence we take birth again to continue our spiritual evolution. Rebirth can take place as a god (deva) a human (manuṣya) an animal (tiryak) — but it is generally taught that the spiritual evolution takes place from lower to highers species. In certain cases of traumatic death a person can take the form of a Preta or Hungry Ghost - and remains in an earth-bound state interminably - until certain ceremonies are done to liberate them. This the the annual Sarva Pitru Amavasya ceremony that is done.,Rami Sivan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Rami-Sivan

But in their destiny they did not met each other and were separated. Meera Bai on the other hand was a devotee who accepted Krishna as her husband. She faced numerous difficulties but never stopped chanting Giridhar Gopal. She believed that there is no one in the world except Krishna. She was addicted to see Krishna. And found him in her soulmate. In her life time She couldn’t meet Krishna yet she didn’t give up. She always sang “mere toh Girdhar Gopal Dusro na koye”. She had lived in Vrindavan several days and at last went to Dwarika. When King Uday Singh of Jodhpur sent some Brahmins to get back Meerabai she didn’t go with them. So all the Brahmins adecided that they will not return. At that time there was being arrangements of Krishna janmasthmi utsav in Dwarika. Devotees was merry in Bhajans. Meera dances and entered sanctum sanctorum of Shri Krishna’s temple. When the door opened people saw that Meera was not there. Her scarf wrapped on the statue and statue was being extremely lighted. Meera was contained in statue. She was meeting with her beloved. So finally Meera met Gopal. It was her devotion which turned into love. While Radha was a lover and it was Krishna who was actually a devotee of Radha. Radha ji told to Krishna that he can go and seek out his Dwarkadheesh image but every home every temple will stand with me. For Krishna Radha was Superior to Meera ji. Though he never comapred them but that's just my interpretation. But for me Meera ji is superior who gave everything to her love even without seeing him. Wo to Radha Ka bhi shyam Wo to Meera ka bhi shyam. One other note here is the controversial view of Mr. Devdoot Patnaik. According to him “The problem here is that Radha is a mythical character who comes to us from Jayadeva's Gita Govinda composed 800 years ago and Meera is a historical princess and poet-saint who lived 400 years ago in Rajasthan who was very real.” Strange but that's what he believes. According to him no ancient scriptures mentioned Radha ji. According to him due to myth of Radha world completely ignores Krishna's legitimate wives Rukmini and Satyabhama Kalindi and Jambavat and other junior wives. For me Mr. Devdoot Patnaik is a No. 1 fool and you can't win an argument with a fool. Please comment your thoughts in comment section. I am eagerly waiting for them.,Deepika Mathur,https://www.quora.com/profile/Deepika-Mathur-12

He has sung many film songs also in South Indian films and Bollywood films. Another legend Shri S.P.BALASUBRAMANYAM recently washed the feet of Shri Yesudas as a mark of respect.

RelatedWas Rudra mentioned in the Vedas the same god as Shiva mentioned in the Puranas?,https://www.quora.com/Was-Rudra-mentioned-in-the-Vedas-the-same-god-as-Shiva-mentioned-in-the-Puranas,https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b076e70ccb2692feb6f619ebf706ecd8,Openly from the deeper practical spiritual point of view any Puranic characteristic of any gods mentioned in Vedas cannot be the same as Vedic one. The main reason is that the Vedic time was not a religious time (as we know the religion nowadays) and Puranic time was already typically religious time. It follows that the terms devotion belief and worship naturally have different meaning in Vedic and Puranic times. In the Vedic time the devotion belief and worship had actually scientific character (realistic in relation to daily life - practical experiential wisdom) while the devotion belief and worship in Puranic time had already religious character (not realistic in relation to daily life – devotional religious knowledge). Thus even there could be a traditional view that Shiva is the same as Rudra it does not mean that both (Vedic and Puranic) interpretations of Rudra and Shiva are the same. To answer the question: Rudra mentioned in Vedas is not the same as Shiva mentioned in Puranas. Despite of this fact the Puranic interpretations and attitudes towards Shiva can have connotations with interpretations of Rudra.,Stefan Pecho,https://www.quora.com/profile/Stefan-Pecho

The arguments advance by the Monotheists are all refuted by the Hindu logicians. The most common argument used by Muslims Jews and Christians is the creation/creator proposition (or watchmaker argument) based on a geocentric linear concept of time and space. It goes like this:–There is a complex and diverse creation.All created things must have a creator.The world therefore must have a creatorThat creator is God/Allah/JehovahThe problem with this syllogism is that it is based on a linear concept of time. According to the monotheists there is a God who exists in eternity and then one day creates a world (i.e. earth) from nothing and then after a while destroys the world and creates a paradise and a hell - both of which are also eternal. All of this occurs in endless and supposedly beginingless time with planet Earth as the center of this universe and mankind as the special focus of God's attention. In Hindu logic the invariable concomitance between a creator and a creation needs to be observed in order to draw the conclusion. Otherwise the opponent will ask - ""who created the creator?"" The rejoined is always ""the Creator is Self-created"" - another logical impossibility leading to regress infinitum. So one is trying to prove something of which the premise is also unproven. The Hindu argument is based on observation - all things are born exist and die in cycles the linear meme is nowhere to be found. Everything is comprised of atoms which conjoin to create compounds and separate and conjoin again to form other compounds. Consciousness is inseparable from matter (bio-centric view) and there is a kind of a pattern in this web of the Universe (known as Indra's net). This combination of quantum matter and consciousness is called BRAHMAN — ""The Immensity"" The universe has existed according to science about 13.8 billion years. According to the Vedas the age of the universe is 155521972949115 years. According to the Vedic concept of time cycles there is the Big Bang – expansion – contraction – the Big Crunch – a period of latency and then the cycle begins again - an eternal pulsating process of Becoming. This entire phenomenon is referred to as BRAHMAN. So according to Hinduism (using Monotheistic terminology) there is no creator God who creates in infinity the entire universe IS God and apart from God nothing exists. According to the Vedas - ‘sarvam khalvidam brahma’. Space Time and Matter are all what we call BRAHMAN or “God”. Here’s a photo of God.",Rami Sivan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Rami-Sivan

One more Important Point is Mr.Ambedkar and his followers did not suffer due to untouchability they are the Elite Class of SC/ST and enjoy these Benefits in the disguise of untouchability. They claim to be Hindus and get Benefits of Reservations also Practice Christianity for Missionary Money and Benefits ☺️☺️. The actual untouchables have been in Villages in Bharat and working as Small Farmers or Farm Laborers even today. By the way Mr.Ambedkar is not his Surname his Birth Surname is Sakpal. Ambedkar was the Surname of his Brahmin Teacher in High School. If he did not like Caste why did he keep Brahmin Surname Ambedkar? Because using Ambedkar Name he could get mingle with High Class British Society and could get High end Jobs and Positions and finally could secure the position of Lead of Indian Constitution Committee. He never Participated in Bharatiya Freedom Struggle and tried his best to ensure that Bharat will be under British Rule and will not get Independence. Mr.Ambedkar (Sakpal) was highly selfish.,Sridhara Sharma Palepu,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sridhara-Sharma-Palepu

Some of the television production has created another level of perception about him which is totally ridiculous. Yesterday I finishedSrimad Bhagavatam and it made me clear that Krishna was more than just a mischievous being. He was the butter mobster till the age of 8 and he was around the girls till the age of 16. After the age of sixteen his guru made him realized the purpose of life and he left the Vrindavan flute Radha and all his ladylove and never came back that was the end of it. From the age of 16 to 21 He went through severe sadhanas and lived as a Brahmachari. After that his entire life was committed to political life with the spiritual process. These things are never spoken before but in the northern plains of India he set up over one thousand ashrams. he wanted to bring spiritual cycle as mainstream life not as an impediment. He has a mission of his own life to enlighten people to political process with the help of spirituality.He knew that in the future people will lose their sight that's why he created all the facade of Kurukshetra to educate us about “mysterious Geeta”. Today We call him Lord because after being in all the terrible situation he was still playful and untouched by reality.Fools deride Me( Krishna) when I descend in the human form.

Vedanta literally means ‘End of the Vedas’. The Upanishads are a means to understand the Vedas. We can’t just bypass the Vedas and read the Upanishads directly.The Vedas have to much data that has to be understood and converted into knowledge. The Upanishads are a means to extract the essence of the Vedas. Every verse of the Vedas contain a part of the thinking mechanism and the means to understand it. The same thing is looked at from all angles. Some verses are more directly about Brahman and others are very indirectly about Brahman.Rig Veda is most directly about Brahman. Thus the Upanishads can be considered to be a means to understand Rig Veda. Rig Veda has 1028 Suktas and all of them are not equally important. 289 Suktas of Rig Veda are about Indra who symbolizes the starting point of the thinking mechanism and 214 about Agni who is a means to understand Brahman.The Upanishads enable us to separate the thinking mechanism from the thoughts generated by it. Thus we realize that Purusha Sukta 10.90 Surya Sukta 1.50 Ashwa 1.163 which are about the entire seven stages are more important in understanding Brahman.What are important has to be understood precisely. This makes Aham Brahmasmi Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.10 the most important tool to understand Brahman.Mandukya Upanishad is about Nirguna Brahman.

I have tried to offer a taste with the photos below. The first one shows a bas-relief on Angkor Wat and the second one ubiquitous Apsara dancers of which allegedly no two are the same. From a sheer craftsmanship perspective the detail to be found on the temple walls is staggering. In addition do not be fooled into assuming that these displays of artistry are unique to the illustrious walls of Angkor Wat. You will find remarkable images sculpted onto even the most innocuous of rocks and ruins throughout the temple complex. Surprises await around every nook and cranny if you're willing to look for them... Tranquility: I did not know the meaning of tranquility until I sat at the top of an old palace in Angkor Thom surveying the scene below and listening to the oddly rhythmic beat of torrential rain from which I was fortunately shielded by the stone ceiling above.   If you go during the low season as my friend and I did you will find that the Angkor temples can be a remarkably tranquil and relaxing place. For me this was not due solely to the relative lack of crowds (an impressive number of fellow travellers turned up to watch the famed Angkor sunrise with us).  Instead there was something about Angkor which struck a quiet tone of reverence amongst it's spectators an atmosphere I cannot remember encountering in any other major destination I have visited. Where St. Peter's Basilica or the Hagia Sophia produced an audible buzz of excitement amongst visitors the travellers at Angkor generally seemed compelled to observe quietly too awed with the scale and significance of what they were seeing to chatter their way through it (at least we were). This created an art-gallery like atmosphere where people tended to inspect and reflect upon what they are seeing in a relative state of reverie. This only adds to the magic of Angkor -  even though you may be surrounded by fellow travellers you may feel like you have one of the world's most compelling places to yourself.  ,Chang Liu,https://www.quora.com/profile/Chang-Liu-1

Subhadra was his sister and Balram was his brother. knowledge of Holy Shrimad Bhagavad Gita There are numerous verses to consider from Srimad Bhagavad Gita which prove there is some other Supreme God about whom the narrator of Gita Ji (seeming to be Shri Krishna Ji) refers. Let us study them to understand who delivered the knowledge of Holy Srimad Bhagavad Gita. Brahm (Kaal) had pledged that he would never appear before anyone in his original form. He is the narrator of the Holy Gita. Gita Adhyay 11 Shlok 32 By entering into Shri Krishan Ji's body like a ghost Kaal is saying ""Arjun I am an enlarged Kaal. I have appeared now to eat all the loks”. Gita Adhyay 7 Shlok 25 the giver of the knowledge of Bhagavad Gita ie. Kaal says: Arjun I remain hidden with my yog-maya (mystic powers) I do not come in front of anyone. This is my bad (cheap) firm rule this is my incorruptible rule. Foolish people not knowing my bad ie. Inferior eternal main character consider the unmanifested / invisible me as having come in human form i.e. I am not Krishna. Gita Adhyay 11 Shlok 47 Speaker of Gita-Kaal says This is my actual Kaal form. Nobody can see this ie. attain Brahm by any method mentioned in the Vedas or by jap tap or by any other activity. This proves that the speaker of pious Gita Ji is not Lord Krishna but someone else (Kaal / Brahm) who says ‘I am an enlarged Kaal’. He counsels Arjun to fight the battle imparts knowledge and describes who is the Supreme God? who should be worshipped by devotees to attain eternal world and supreme peace ie. salvation. Various slokas of Holy Gita this Kaal-God (giver of the knowledge of pious Gita Ji) glorifies the Master of Lineage the creator of the universe the Supreme God. Let us review the dialogues held in the battlefield in Kurukshetra during the war of Mahabharata between Kaal/Brahm and the warrior Arjun. Arjun had refused to fight the battle realizing the catastrophic aftermaths of the war. At that time Kaal entered into the body of Lord Krishna like a ghost and provokes him to fight.

Both presented their views and when words were not enough the gods got into a terrible battle. As they were engaged in their conflict a gigantic pillar of fire (Agni-Stambha) appeared in their midst stunning them and halting their battle. Bewildered by its length which seemed to be going beyond the heavens and underworld Vishnu and Brahma took the form of a boar and swan respectively and began their journey to the opposite ends of the pillar. After having exhausted themselves completely without coming to a fruitful end both the gods approached the flaming pillar and asked it to enlighten them about its true nature. The fire pillar then told the gods that it was nothing but a form of Shiva which is the primordial essence of the universe. He is seen unseen most beautiful yet formless beginning and end life and death and the source of the powers of all gods sages humans and demons. After making Lord Vishnu and Brahma realize their folly Shiva appeared in front of them. This Puranic episode enlightens us on the supreme powers of Shiva who is seen as above all gods. He is the Adi-yogi (the first yogi) and Adi Deva (the first god). He is the manifestation of Purusha (the male primordial element) which is on the basis of Srishti (creation). Even in the episodes that talk about his togetherness with Shakti or Prakriti (the female counterpart of Purusha) Shiva and Shakti are the source of life and their potent forms as Bhairava and Mahakali are its end.

Answer: First of all let us get a clarity as to who are Asuras and Devas. According  to scriptures there are certain beings mentioned which include  Gandharvas Yakshas Kinneras Kimpurushas Rakshasas Nagas Suparnas  Vanaras Vidyadharas Valakilyas Pisachas Devas and Asuras.Within  Devas you again have Vasus Rudras Maruts Adityas and within the  Asuras you have Danavas Daityas Kalakeyas and Nivatakavachas.So first of all Asuras are different from Rakshasas and Pisachas if  that is what you meant.Devas and Asuras are born out of the same father sage Kashyapa.In  the Rigveda the asuras preside over moral and social phenomena. Among  the asuras are Varuna the guardian of Rta and Aryaman the patron of  marriages. Conversely the Sura or Devas preside over natural  phenomena. Among the devas are the Ushas whose name means ""dawn"" and  Indra the leader of the Devas. In fact if you even go deeper this classification holds only for the present Manvantara.Our  present Manvantara is called Vaivasvata Manvantara or Shraaddhdev  Manvantara as noted below. So the Indra for this Manvantara is Purandar  who is a Deva.But if you clearly see the next Manvantara i.e Savarni has Bali as the Indra. He is the famous Mahabali known after the Onam festival who belonged to the Asura clan. So you see even Indra can be Asura.(See Indra) For more on Manvantara see Manvantara​So  both Devas and Asuras can be equally bad and good. Similarly Yaksha  Kinnera Kimpurusha Nagas etc all these beings can also be both good  and bad.Next who  are some good Asuras? The famous Prahalad Mahabali Vibhishana  Aryamann (in fact in Hindu mythology he is the witness for vedic  marriage ceremony). Ravana who is the villan of epic Ramayana is often  regarded as a very pious Asura from his mother's lineage.So none of these above mentioned Asuras are potrayed as you mentioned. That is devilish dark and violent.Similarly if you want good examples from Rakshasa clan I can immediately remember Ghatotkacha Hidimbi etc. Similarly there are evil in both of them too. In fact there are evil Devas too. So in short there is nothing called Devas superior to Asuras.It may be that because Indra of the present Manvantara is a Deva things might be little partial to Devas.For  example Chandra deva belongs to the Deva clan. But he has done many  mistakes and had illicit relations. He is also cursed a lot of times. He  is an example of a bad Deva.Now let me answer the main question: Is Ravana Asura or Raakshasa?  Ravana is a son born to Vishrava and Kaikesi. Let us look at the ancestry of Vishrava and Kaikesi.Kaikesi is the daughter of Sumali and Tataki. Thataki was a Yaksha princess-turned-Raakshasi. Suketu a yaksha king was her father.  Sumali is the maternal grandfather of Ravana. He was an Asura King. To be more particular he was a Daitya His paternal grandfather the sage Pulastya who was one of the ten Prajapatis or mind-born sons of Brahma and one of the Saptarishi (Seven Great Sages Rishi) in the first Manvantara. So Ravana is a son of a mother who was a daughter of a 'Yaksha turned Raakshasa' and a Asuraand a son of a father who was a Sage born to another Sage named Pulastya. Also Kubera a yaksha king is his brother. So yeah who is Ravana? Not Asura or Raakshasa. He is a Raakshasa+Asura+Brahmin+Yaksha.",Auro Sista (ఆరో శిష్ఠా),https://www.quora.com/profile/Auro-Sista-%E0%B0%86%E0%B0%B0%E0%B1%8B-%E0%B0%B6%E0%B0%BF%E0%B0%B7%E0%B1%8D%E0%B0%A0%E0%B0%BE

For more curious beings there is a detailed explanation on this👇Deves · Nov 10When we go deep into the meditative state we reach the state of void nothingness. What is beyond this state? Is it possible to reach a state where we can observe the creation of the void itself?I WILL KEEP UPDATING THIS ANSWER AS THERE IS TOO MUCH TO SHARE SO YOU CAN BASICALLY READ IN INSTALLMENTS😂 I will tell about my geographical culture and the way of life I was born in  Sanatan.Just be patient while reading. First you need to understand the basics of spirituality in simple and easy words which no one tells. It is said in Hinduism “parmaatma resides everywhere”. This is also true but no one exlprores why it is said. You need to understand reality. Reality is something that cannot be put into words because no one knows what reality is the moment we put reality into words is the moment reality fades away our brain perceives the word “reality” as reality .Reality is often between the words. It can only be felt and its first experience is just its visual imagination which is the gateway to reality.We read words but we do not see the gap between each word. We ignore the gap is it means nothing or “shunya” ie. “0″. The shunya is reality. Our brain always keeps thinking. But if we observe. Their is always a minute gap between the thoughts. As we shift from the thought of brushing our teeth to going to a date their is a minute gap between these 2 thoughts. That darkness and silence is the reality. But it is just the experience of 1st phase of reality. The reality is far beyond our 5 senses. We are made of material. We live in 3D world. We use only 5% of our brain. We have 64 dimensions written in vedas and we try to understand Paramatma with our 1200grams of brain living in 3rd dimension. Suppose a bacteria living in a cave it borns reproduces and dies after completing his life span. He never saw sky only saw cave walls covering him. It percieves that only area as his sky his world. He applies his minute brain and thinks he knows the reality. Same are we humans. A phone call can reach at any corner of the world and people think how can god be everywhere. We are bonded in laws of universe. We think we are doing the things but in reality universe is doing everything. We think we are lifting waits and can build body. We train and lift heavy waits we get tired.But we forget that we are bond to the universe’s law of gravity that is not allowing me to do thing that i want to do after a certain limit. We are bonded. It is a law that we will age and die no matter what and it always happens to everybody. Paramatma says He wants us to understand him in his (tatva roop)molecular form.  Paramatma says he is in you you need to find me. I am beyond your senses. When you rise above the hormonal pleasures you find paramatma. Lets take “joy” in points. Suppose if you are sitting idle your joy will be 2–3points you buy a car your joy is 6 points you have sex you joy is 15 points. But once you rise above the sexual pleasure you feel a diffrent kind of pleasure known as Paramanand which will be like 100 points. It is continous flow of joy. When you were a kid you used to think biggest joy was to play around when you grew up you think sex is biggest pleasure because you have never experienced param anand. Some people say Shiv linga means private part of shiva. But reality is upside down. We experience too much pleasure only if our private part is stimulated. Private part acquires only some area of your body. You get pleasure only through that area. But once you dive in param anand. Your whole body becomes stimutated to the core. Whole body becomes like linga. That is it to denote it.A blow of air can give you so much pleasure than your imagination. Thats why some people become Sanyasis and live their rest of life meditating because they do not seek pleasure from external material source of less points. Because you may think you are going to have a good time with you bf/gf driving a good car and look at a sadhu sitting and meditating and you laugh at them that they are missing real joy of life whereas the reality is you are chasing a 15 point pleasure with material things and the sadhu is diving into 100 points while sitting and being in reality. Sadhu feels self satisfied self lovedeuphoria words will get over but you cant write in words the real pleasure of paramanand.  Once an experiment was conducted about waves good words such as “Thankyou” produced soft and symmetrical waves on ice surface while cursed words produced irregular waves. Everything in this world is the byproduct of waves frequencies. It is written in vedas that the creation began when damru beats of lord shiva began striking and rythming ommmmm. It is personified to make us understand. Hinduism is not a religion. It is ultimate reality. It is the oldest. We say lord ganesha is an elephant like guy. But in reality lord ganesha is god of intelligence. For intelligence signs were created like brain to denote him. As it is the oldest religion. Chances are that people over generations did not read and understand scriptures that they came with this crap.  .Paramatma or Supersoul when looked at it molecular form is made of same energy which resides in every single human beings. Its never found because it is grabbed by 5 senses and material urges. You are like a sub part of supersoul bond in a hormone driven brain living in a tiny material planet at some corner of universe. When you meditate your 5 senses drops one by one any your inner soul is synced with energy of paramatma. Just like if this bottle gets the sence of body and gets driven by hormones it will never be able to know it has water inside it just like the whole sea. Now personify the bottle and make buildings and all worldly things inside the rest sea water area…you will see a new Maya World created in your imagination.  We basically live in a dream. We are part of something great but we a always live in illusion. We never feel we are bond with time and each second passing we are moving towards the “Reality” that is death. After death your senses won’t work only pure consciousness will remain. That is when you merge into reality. Sometimes many people do many wrong things like cheating on their partner killing someone raping a teenage girl and the incident never came out. Their senses make them feel do those things but each time they do something wrong the frequency of their soul goes down that is the gut feeling which your senses instantly rub under your shoe soul of ego and anger which again in influenced by hormones which is also a material in body and will docompose with the body one day.After his death his polluted soul would not be able to match its energy frequency of the supersoul which is the source of happiness. It will face a repulsion and will get stuck in lower frequency dimension personified as Nark or Hell. It is said hell because the pure consciousness or the soul is in too much depressed condition because of their deeds…but they would not have material brains to secrete bliss hormones while watching tv or having sex. It is just pure consciousness that remaines now. Which again has to get in the cycle of time and face birth and death. When you go into space from earthin your mindyou cross all the layers of atmosphere and you travel more and more to several lakhs kms you find an imaginary layer. That is the layer till where TIME works  Everything is just a work of waves. The waves produced made this world of maya. Maya world is material world away from reality. If we cut the bottle in the sea at the above figure water will merge into sea knowing its real identity and leave bottle as it was maya and material same as humans. Everything is going in a time frame. Paramatma is beyond all this. It is a pure consciousness. Everthing is happening in paramatma the maya is the part of paramatma you are a part of him too he is everywhere. He is much more greater than time. He himself created TIME which is in turn an illusion through waves. When we die we get merged in that supreme consciousness thus experiencing all dimensions and knowing “all pasts” and “all futures” because ultimately everything is happening in paramatma himself. Thats how our ancestor sadhus came to know about future and predicted future because they synced themselves with the dimension which is beyond time they matched their frequencies with that of paramatma in which every past present and future resides.   In this video you can see the monk is in param anand he is at that stage of consciousness where he identifies himself as God (Soul) and the level of pleasure is bigger than the pain of burning to death for him. When we meditate we basically see an inside dark world of silence. We gradually dive deeper and deeper to our consciousness. We start by meditating we feel our brain so crowded because of negative thoughts in reality those thoughts are not coming but going away from your mind thats why you see slideshow of some negative moments when you meditate. As your thoughts keep going out you dive deeper from conscious brain to subconscious brain and ultimalely with extensive practice you reach to a consciousness of our non material or molecular body. When you reach there the supersoul energy that is all around you will began syncing with your soul energy and you will lose the sense of body. You will feel satisfied complete within yourself. You don’t need any external stimulation for pleasure. You are always in joy now because now you know you are one with Paramatma. No fear can defeat you like the burning monk above no body can threat you no one will be at your level in life. Paramatma contains everything you can imagine and things that you can not imagine. If your mind is pure with meditation and you have gratefullness paramatma takes a form of which ever idol you worship with same pure state of mind. He only sees your intensions he loves you and will form any “form” that you worship him because all Brahma Vishnu and Mahesh have different roles because they constitute different dimensionsbut at the molecular level they are all inside paramatma. Paramatma has no face no colour he is everywhere you just don’t have to apply logic and senses to experience him. He is unimaginable you can never imagine Paramatma who constitutes all dimensions all time frame all pasts all future everything with a 3rd dimensional hormonal brain that is not even as big comapred to earth i guess? He is anant he is shiv he is denoted by Shiv Linga as it has no shape. It is neither round nor cylindrical neitger square neither rectangle or cone.,Deves,https://www.quora.com/profile/Deves-1

The Islamic dogmas on God are rigid and absolute. Hinduism’s view range from atheism to polytheism with every flavour in between. But this is only the tip of the theological iceberg which is largely unexplored. The theological difference are not simply “monotheism” (Tawḥīd) but the implications of that belief. There are many Hindu sects which hold with monotheism of one sort or the other and even the other Islamic bugbear “idolatry” is superficial. So let’s assume for the argument that there is only one God creator of the universe - what is the nature of this God and what should our relationship with this God be? In Islam Allah is completely other. He is removed from his creation and is unknowable and transcendent. Everything including Heaven earth and hell are his creations but he is different from them - so even in Heaven (jannat) the successful and victorious believers will never be in his company or have a direct experience of him. Hinduism on the other hand teaches that God is both immanent in his creation/projection (which is actually his “corporeality” as it were) and also transcends the Universe. Then the next point of contention is what should our relationship to God be? In Islam there is only one acceptable relationship - slave/master (‘abed/mālik). In Hinduism there are different relationships suitable to all devotional types.Parent - child. The devotee regards God as her mother or father - (this relationship is shared by both Judaism and Christianity)Child - Parent. In this the roles are reversed and the devotee treats God as her own child.Friend - friend. The devotee treats God as a personal friend playing with him confiding in him etc. (Arjuna and Krishna exemplify this relationship).Servant - master. This is similar to the Islamic form but tempered by love rather than awe and fear - exemplified by Hanuman.Husband - wife. The devotee treats God as his spouse - usually playing the part of the wife.Lover - beloved. This is the supreme state of Bhakti Yoga in which the devotee is lost in rapture and love of God and seeks conjugal union with him. This relationship is exemplified by Radha and Krishna. This absolute and overwhelming focus on LOVE as the connection between God and souls is the basis of all forms of mysticism. We find this passionate love affair with God in Sufism as well as in Christian mysticism - a love which is pristine spontaneous free from compulsion simple and direct. GOD is LOVE is the axiom of the Bhakti-schools of all faiths.The highest goal in orthodox Islam is heaven in which Allah is not to be found. The highest goal in Hinduism is complete communion and enjoyment with God (yoga) and heaven is seen just as a trivial distraction. ,Rami Sivan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Rami-Sivan

Look at it without any biases that you might have been fed with since long and you will know the truth. This presents photographs (listed below) that show the Vedic influence found in such buildings as the Taj Mahal Red Fort and other structures in India. In fact as recently as 1910 the Encyclopedia Brittanica also said that it was a pre-existing building before Shah Jahan. It is because of the manipulation of history by invaders that the true greatness of India and Vedic culture has been stifled or hidden. And it is time that people everywhere realize how numerous lies and false propaganda have been passed around as if it were the truth in regard to India and its past as well as its art archeology and the wonder of its culture. Descriptions of the Photographs of the Taj MahalPhoto # 1: “An aerial view of the Taj Mahal alias Tejo Mahalaya ancient Hindu temple complex in Agra. For the last 300 years the world has been fooled to believe that this stupendous edifice was built by the 5th generation Mogul emperor Shahjahan to commemorate one of his dead wives–Mumtaz. The two flanking buildings although identical only the one in the rear is known as a mosque. The Taj Mahal has seven stories. Five of them lie sealed and barred concealing rich evidence. The marble building in the centre is flanked by two symmetrical ones. The one in the foreground is the eastern one. The one in the background is being represented as a mosque because it is to the west. They should not have been identical if only one was to be a mosque. In the courtyard at the foot of the eastern building is inlaid a full scale replica of the trident pinnacle [found at the top of the dome]. The tiny tower at the left near the western building encloses a huge octagonal multi-storied well.”[1]Photo # 2: “This is the massive octagonal well with palatial apartments along its seven stories. A royal staircase descends right down to the water level indicated by the tiny white patch showing the sun’s reflection. This was the traditional treasury well of the Hindu temple palace. Treasure chests used to be stacked in the lower stories. Accountants cashiers and treasurers sat in the upper stories. Cheques called handies used to be issued from here. On being besieged if the building had to be surrendered to the enemy the treasure used to be pushed into the water for salvage later after recapture. For real research water should be pumped out of this well to reveal the evidence that lies at the bottom. This well is inside a tower near the so-called mosque to the west of the marble Taj. Had the Taj been a mausoleum this octagonal multistoried well would have been superfluous.” [1] [2]Photo # 3: “A frontal view of the Taj Mahal alias Tejo Mahalaya in Agra. It is octagonal because the Hindus believe in 10 directions. The pinnacle pointing to the heaven and the foundation to the nether world plus the eight surface directions make the 10 directions. Divinity and royalty are believed to hold sway in all those 10 directions. Hence in Hindu tradition buildings connected with royalty and divinity must have some octagonal features or the buildings themselves should be octagonal. The two flanking cupolas (two others to the rear are not seen in this photo) are also identical. The towers at the four plinth corners served as watch towers during the day and to hold lights at night. Hindu wedding altars and Satyanarayan worship altars invariably have such towers at corners. [Many other Hindu temples such as those at Khajurao also can be found to have four towers or temples one at each corner of the temple foundation.] The lotus flower cap on the head of the dome is a Hindu feature. Muslim domes are bald. This marble edifice has four stories. Inside the dome is an 83 ft. high hall. The Taj has a double dome. The dome one sees from inside ends like an inverted pan on the terrace. The dome seen from outside is a cover on the inner dome. Therefore in between them is an 83 ft. hall. This may be considered as one storey. Underneath may be seen the first storey arches and the ground floor rooms. In the basement visitors are shown one room. All these constitute the four storeys in the marble edifice. Below the marble structure are two stories in red stone reaching down to the river level. The 7th storey must be below the river level because every ancient Hindu historic building did have a basement. Thus the Taj is a seven-storied structure.” [1] [2]Photo # 4: “The dome of the Taj Mahal bearing a trident pinnacle made of a non-rusting eight-metal Hindu alloy. The pinnacle served as a lightning deflector too. This pinnacle has been blindly assumed by many to be an Islamic crescent and star or a lightning conductor installed by the British. This is a measure of the careless manner in which Indian history has been studied till now. Visually identifiable things like this pinnacle too have been misinterpreted with impunity. The flower top of the dome below the pinnacle is an unmistakable Hindu sign. A full scale figure of this pinnacle is inlaid in the eastern courtyard.”[1] [2]Photo # 5: “A close up of the upper portion of the pinnacle of the Taj Mahal photographed from the parapet beneath the dome. The Hindu horizontal crescent and the coconut top together look like a trident from the garden level. Islamic crescents are always oblique. Moreover they are almost always complete circles leaving a little opening for a star. This Hindu pinnacle had all these centuries been misinterpreted as an Islamic crescent and star or a lightning conductor installed by the British. The word “Allah” etched here by Shahjahan is absent in the courtyard replica. The coconut the bent mango leaves under it and the supporting Kalash (water pot) are exclusive Hindu motifs.”[1]Photo # 6: “The full scale figure of the pinnacle on the dome has been inlaid on the red stone courtyard of the Taj Mahal. One may see it to the east at the foot of the riverside arch of the flanking building wrongly dubbed as Jamiat Khana (community hall) by Muslim usurpers. Such floor sketches in courtyards are a common Hindu trait. In Fatehpur Sikri it is the backgammon board which is sketched on a central courtyard. The coconut top and the bent mango leaves underneath resting on a kalash (i.e. a water pot) is a sacred Hindu motif. Hindu shrines in the Himalayan foothills have identical pinnacles [especially noticed at Kedarnath a prominent Shiva temple]. The eastern location of the sketch is also typically Hindu. The length measures almost 32 ft.” [1]Photo # 7: “The apex of the lofty entrance arch on all four sides of the Taj Mahal bears this red lotus and white trident–indicating that the building originated as a Hindu temple. The Koranic lettering forming the middle strip was grafted after Shahjahan seized the building from Jaipur state’s Hindu ruler.” [1]Photo # 8: “This is a riverside view of the Taj Mahal. The four storied marble structure above has under it these two stories reaching down to the river level. The 22 rooms shown in other photos are behind that line of arches seen in the middle. Each arch is flanked by Hindu lotus discs in white marble. Just above the ground level is the plinth. In the left corner of the plinth is a doorway indicating inside the plinth are many rooms sealed by Shahjahan. One could step out to the river bank from the door at the left. The 7th storey is surmised to be under the plinth below the ground because every ancient Hindu mansion had a basement. Excavation to reach the basement chamber should start under this door.” [1]Photo # 9: “Most people content to see Mumtaz’s grave inside the Taj fail to go to the rear riverside. This is the riverside view. From here one may notice that the four-storied marble structure on top has below it two more stories in red stone. Note the window aperture in the arch at the left. That indicates that there are rooms inside. Inside the row of arches in the upper part of the wall are 22 rooms. In addition to the four stories in marble this one shows red stone arches in the 5th storey. The 6th storey lies in the plinth in the lower portion of the photo. In another photo a doorway would be seen in the left corner of the plinth indicating the presence of apartments inside from where one could emerge on the river for a bath.” [1]Photo # 10: “These corridors at the approach of the Taj Mahal are typically Hindu. They may be seen in any ancient Hindu capital. Note the two octagonal tower cupolas at the right and left top. Only Hindus have special names for the eight directions and celestial guards assigned to each. Any octagonal feature in historic buildings should convince the visitor of their Hindu origin. Guards palanquin bearers and other attendants resided in hundreds of rooms along numerous such corridors when the Taj Mahal was a Hindu temple palace. Thus the Taj was more magnificent and majestic before it was reduced to a sombre Islamic cemetery.” [1] [2]Photo # 11: “This Naqqar Khana alias Music House in the Taj Mahal garden is an incongruity if the Taj Mahal were an Islamic tomb. Close by on the right is the building which Muslims claim to be a mosque. The proximity of a mosque to the Music House is incongruous with Muslim tradition. In India Muslims have a tradition of pelting stones on Hindu music processions passing over a mosque. Moreover a mausoleum needs silence. A dead person’s repose is never to be disturbed. Who would then provide a band house for a dead Mumtaz? Contrarily Hindu temples and palaces have a music house because morning and evening Hindu chores begin to the sweet strains of sacred music.” [1]Photo # 12: “Such are the rooms on the 1st floor of the marble structure of the Taj Mahal. The two staircases leading to this upper floor are kept locked and barred since Shahjahan’s time. The floor and the marble walls of such upper floor rooms can be seen in the picture to have been stripped of its marble panels. Shahjahan used that uprooted marble from the upper floor for constructing graves and engraving the Koran because he did not know wherefrom to procure marble matching the splendour of the rest of the Taj Mahal. He was also so stingy as not to want to spend much even on converting a robbed Hindu temple into an Islamic mausoleum.” [1] [2]Photo # 13: “Such are the magnificent marble-paved shining cool white bright rooms of the Taj Mahal temple palace’s marble ground floor. Even the lower third portion of the walls is covered with magnificent marble mosaic. The doorway at the left looks suspiciously closed with a stone slab. One can perambulate through these rooms around the central octagonal sanctorum now occupied by Mumtaz’s fake grave. The aperture seen through of the central door enabled perambulating devotees to keep their eyes fixed on the Shiva Linga in the central chamber. Hindu Shiva Lingas are consecrated in two chambers one above the other. Therefore Shahjahan had to raise two graves in the name of Mumtaz–one in the marble basement and the other on the ground floor to desecrate and hide both the Shiva emblems from public view. [The famous Shiva temple in Ujjain also has an underground chamber for one of its Shiva-lingams.]” [1] [2]Photo # 14: “This is the Dhatura flower essential for Hindu Shiva worship. The flower is depicted in the shape of the sacred esoteric Hindu incantation ‘OM.’ Embossed designs of this blooming ‘OM’ are drawn over the exterior of the octagonal central sanctorum of Shiva where now a fake grave in Mumtaz’s has been planted. While perambulating around the central chamber one may see such ‘OM’ designs.” [1]Photo # 15: “This staircase and another symmetrical one at the other end lead down to the storey beneath the marble platform. Visitors may go to the back of the marble plinth at the eastern or western end and descend down the staircase because it is open to the sky. But at the foot the archaeology department has set up an iron door which it keeps locked. Yet one may peep inside from the iron gate in the upper part of the door. Shahjahan had sealed even these two staircases. It was the British who opened them. But from Shahjahan’s time the stories below and above the marble ground floor have been barred to visitors. We are still following Mogul dictates though long free from Mogul rule.” [1]Photo # 16: “On the inner flank of the 22 locked rooms (in the secret storey in red stone below the marble platform) is this corridor about 12 ft. broad and 300 ft. long. Note the scallop design at the base of the plinth supporting the arches. This is the Hindu decoration which enables one to identify even a bare plinth.” [1]Photo # 17: “One of the 22 rooms in the secret storey underneath the marble plinth of the Taj Mahal. Many such features of the Taj remain unknown to the public so long as they see it only as a tomb. If the public knew how much it is missing in the Taj Mahal it will insist that the government unseal its many stories. Two doorways at either end of this corridor in the right side wall leading to inner apartments have been sealed by Shahjahan. If those doorways are opened important evidence concealed inside by Shahjahan may come to light.” [1]Photo # 18: “A corner of one of the 22 rooms in the secret storey immediately below the marble platform of the Taj Mahal. Note the strips of Hindu paint on the wall. The ventilator at the left meant for air and light from the riverside has been crudely walled up by Shahjahan. He did not bother even to plaster them. Had Shahjahan built the Taj as a mausoleum what was the purpose of the 22 rooms? And why are they kept locked and hidden from the public?” [1]Photo # 19: “One of the 22 locked rooms in the secret storey beneath the marble platform of the Taj Mahal. Strips of ancient Hindu paint are seen on the wall flanking the doorway. The niches above had paintings of Hindu idols obviously rubbed off by Muslim desecraters. The rooms may be seen door within door in a row. If the public knew that the Taj Mahal is a structure hiding hundreds of rooms they would insist on seeing the whole of it. At present they only peep into the grave chamber and walk away.” [1]Photo # 20: “This esoteric Hindu design is painted on the ceiling of some of the 22 locked rooms in the secret storey below the marble platform of the Taj Mahal in Agra. Had Shahjahan built the Taj Mahal he would not have kept such elaborately painted rooms sealed and barred to the public. Even now one can enter these rooms only if one can influence the archaeology department to remove the locks.” [1]Photo # 21: “A huge ventilator of one of the 22 rooms in a secret storey of the Taj is seen here crudely sealed with unplastered bricks by Shahjahan. History has been so perverted and inverted that alien Muslims like Shahjahan who spoiled damaged desecrated and destroyed historic Hindu buildings are being falsely paraded as great builders.” [1] [3]Photo # 22: “One of the 22 riverside rooms in a secret storey of the Taj Mahal unknown to the public. Shahjahan far from building the shining marble Taj wantonly disfigured it. Here he has crudely walled up a doorway. Such imperial Mogul vandalism lies hidden from the public. This room is in the red stone storey immediately below the marble platform. Indian history has been turned topsy turvy in lauding destroyers as great builders.” [1]Photo # 23: “Many such doorways of chambers in secret stories underneath the Taj Mahal have been sealed with brick and lime. Concealed inside could be valuable evidence such as Sanskrit inscriptions Hindu idols the original Hindu model of the Taj the desecrated Shiva Linga Hindu scriptures and temple equipment. Besides such sealed chambers there are many which are kept locked by the Government. The Public must raise its voice to have these opened or it should institute legal proceedings. Shree P. N. Sharma of Green Park New Delhi who peeped through an aperture in these chambers in 1934 A.D. saw a pillared hall with images carved on the pillars.” [1] [2] [3]Photo # 24: “Burharpur is a very ancient historic city on the Central Railway between Khandwa and Bhusawal junctions. Burhanpur and the nearby Asirgarh (fort) used to provide hospitality to Hindu royals proceeding north or south on pilgrimage weddings or military expeditions. Barhanpur has many magnificent mansions which are currently being described as mosques and tombs of alien Islamic invaders. This building is one such ancient Hindu royal palace captured by the Moghuls. Mumtaz died here during her 14th delivery around 1630 A.D. while she and Shahjahan were camping here. She is said to be buried in a Hindu pavilion in front of this palace.” [1]Photo # 25: “Mumtaz is supposed to be buried in this garden pavilion of the ancient Hindu palace (Ahu Mahal) 600 miles from Agra in Burhanpur. Another version says that Mumtaz’s corpse was kept here exposed to sun rain and wild beasts for six months. The date of her death the date of her removal from Burhanpur to Agra and the date of her assumed burial in the Taj Mahal are all unknown because the entire Taj Mahal-Mumtaz legend is a concoction from the beginning to end. [Mumtaz was only one of several hundred wives and women that Shahjahan kept in his harem.]” [1] [2] Descriptions of the Photographs of the Red Fort and Other Buildings in Delhi and Elsewhere in IndiaPhoto # 26: “This tablet raised inside Delhi’s Red Fort by modern archaeologists proclaims that Shahjahan (who ruled from 1628 to 1658 A.D.) built this fort from 1639 to 1648 A.D. As against this see the [next] photo of the painting of Shahjahan’s time preserved in the Bodleian Library Oxford. It depicts Shajahan receiving the Persian ambassador inside the fort in 1628 the very year of Shahjahan’s accession. Obviously the fort existed much before Shahjahan.” [1] [3]Photo # 27: “The 5th generation Mogul emperor Shahjahan is credited with having built the Red Fort in Delhi. Shahjahan ascended the throne in 1628 A.D. This contemporary painting shows him receiving the Persian ambassador in 1628 itself in the Diwan-i-Aam (Common Room) of the Red Fort itself. This painting preserved in the Bodleian Library Oxford was reproduced in the Illustrated Weekly of India (page 32) of March 14 1971. Since Shahjahan was in the fort in the year of his accession this documentary evidence disproves the notion that he built the fort. Compare with this the photo of the tablet in English raised inside the fort by the Govt. of India’s archaeology department asserting that Shahjahan built the fort during 1639-48. This is emphatic proof of Indian history having been thoroughly falsified during Muslim rule in India.” [1]Photo # 28: “The Red Fort in Delhi has in its Khas Mahal alias the King’s apartment the royal emblem of its builder King Anangoal. It consists of a pair of swords laid hilt to hilt curving upwards the sacred Hindu pot (kalash) above the hilts a lotus bud and a pair of scales of justice balanced over it. Dotted around are representations of the sun from whom Indian ruling dynasties claimed descent. At the sword points are two small conches considered sacred in Hindu tradition. Bigger conches may be seen at the left and right corners at the base. This royal Hindu insignia of the Hindu king who built Delhi’s Red Fort is still there in the Khas Mahal pavilion. But even this visual symbol has been blatantly misinterpreted. The two swords laid hilt to hilt curving upward are being inadvertently styled by ignorant guides archaeologists and historians as an Islamic crescent. The sacred Hindu Kalash (water pot) on the hilts is never noticed. The lotus bud on the kalash represents royal wealth. The pair of scales is symbolic of impartial justice.” [1]Photo # 29: “This perforated marble screen inside the Khas Mahal (i.e. the King’s own chamber) in Delhi’s Red Fort is a Hindu specialty. Such jalees are mentioned even in Ramayanic descriptions of palaces. Therefore some buildings claimed to be mosques in Ahmedabad which boast of such exquisite jalees (lattices) are Hindu edifices. The Hindu royal emblem mounted on the upper part of the jalee disproves that the Mogul Shahjahan built the fort.” [1] Photos # 30 & 31: “The resplendent Hindu midday sun (from whom Hindu rulers claim descent) in the arch above flanked by the sacred Hindu letter OM. Below it is the royal Hindu insignia. This proves the hollowness of the claim that Shahjahan commissioned the Red Fort.” [1] [2] [3]Photo # 32: “It is entirely false that the Red Fort of Delhi was built by Shahjahan in 1639-48 A.D. Muslims were the destroyers of statues. Then why should they have constructed statues? But there are statues of Hindu Mahavants riding the elephants of the doors of each interior room of “Khas Mahal” in the Red Fort. On the main gate of the Fort named “Delhi Darwaja” there are huge statues of elephants. The curtain of building statues of elephants on forts and palace gates can be well judged by examining the palaces at Gwalior Udaipur and Kota. Decorating homes forts palaces and temples with elephants is a hoary Hindu tradition. To the Hindu an elephant symbolizes might power glory and wealth. The Red Fort in Delhi has life-size elephants at its gate and elephants with riders atop its door knobs in the Khas Mahal pavilion. Had Shahjahan built the fort such Hindu motifs should not have been there.” [3]Photo # 33: “A close up of the elephant and rider door knob in the Khas Mahal of the Red Fort in Delhi. This is a typically Hindu motif. Other big life-size stone elephants decorating the Naqqar Khana (Music House) gate were slaughtered by Islamic invaders. The chopped up pieces may still be seen stored in the Khas Mahal basements. The public must insist on these being joined and displayed.” [4]Photo # 34: “Inner view of the entrance to the so-called Moti Masjid inside Delhi’s Red Fort. The archaeological tablet outside claims that the mosque was built by Aurangzeb son and successor of Shahjahan. That claim is baseless because (1) The entrance is of a temple design. (2) The arch between the domes is made of banana bunches used in Hindu worship. (3) On either side above the arch are fruit trays. (4) Naming buildings after gems (Moti means pearl) is a Hindu custom. (5) If Shahjahan built the fort why didn’t he provide it with a mosque? (6) The truncated Hindu perambulatory passage may still be seen to exist on the building’s left flank. (7) The back of the wall shows signs of tampering.” [1] [3]Photo # 35: “A close-up of the interior top of the entrance arch of the so-called Moti Masjid (which was Hindu Moti Mandir) inside Delhi’s Red Fort. The arch at the bottom may be seen to be made of banana bunches. On either side above the arch are trays holding five fruits each as holy Hindu offering. Fruit is taboo inside Muslim mosques.” [1] [4]Photo # 36: “This temple-front design of ribbed gourd-like domes on either side with a pinnacle surmounted by a canopy in the centre embossed on the riverside wall of the Rang Mahal apartment inside Delhi’s Red fort is emphatic proof that the fort is a pre-Shahjahan Hindu fort. Even the name Rang Mahal is Hindu. In this same pavilion is carved on the floor an exquisite lotus in full bloom as a fountain trough. Muslim walls and floors are plain. The canopy in the photo may be seen at several Hindu altars. The kalash (pot) under it represents divinity in Hindu tradition.” [1]Photo # 37: ‘”Vishnu’s footprint’ in the so-called Humayun Tomb New Delhi. This photo is reproduced from page 78 of “The World of Ancient India” translated into English (from G. Le Bon’s original French book published in the 19th century) by David Macrae Tudor Publishing co. New York 1974. This photo proves that the so-called Humayun mausoleum is an ancient Hindu temple palace. Inquiries with archaeologists in Delhi drew a blank They have never seen these footprints which indicates that they are heir to a lot of non-information and mis-information. Humayun is not at all buried in Delhi. According to Farishta’s chronicle (English translation by John Briggs Vol. II page 174) Humayun is buried in Agra while according to Abul Fazal (Elliot & Dowson Vol. VI page 22) Humayun lies buried in Sirhind.” [1] [2]Photo # 38: “A panel of the so-called Kutab tower in Delhi. The exquisite serpentine Hindu pattern in the upper part is the wreath called ‘Makar Torana’ because it emanates from the mouth of a crocodile. This is a very common sacred Hindu motif in historic buildings. The Islamic tampering and forgery in stone may be seen in the lower portion. An attempt has been made to plant Koranic lettering. Such forgery in stone fooled even historians who thereby inadvertently ascribed those buildings to Muslim authorship.”[1]Photo # 39: “This remnant of a temple around the so-called Kutab Minar in Delhi has been named ‘Kuwat-ul-Islam’ mosque by the conqueror Kutubuddin in the closing years of the 12th century A.D. The term signifies “The Strength of Islam” in capturing and battering a Hindu temple and blatantly using it as a mosque. Ignorant historians who could not explain away the Hindu workmanship foolishly concluded that the Muslims demolished some other temple and carried the Hindu pillars hither to raise this ‘mosque (?).’ This is an absurdity from every point of view. Muslims only seized Hindu temples and pressed them into service as mosques.” [1] Photo # 40 & #41: “Muslim captors dismantled surface stones of the so-called Kutab tower in Delhi reversed them and inscribed Koran on the exterior. This Muslim forgery in stone came to light as those stones started falling off the tower. Here we can see the Hindu images on one side while the next view Photo # 41: reveals the subsequent Islamic lettering on the other.” [1]Photo # 42: “Four miles from the so-called Kutab Minar in Delhi is an ancient Hindu temple palace currently known as Sultan Ghari. An uncrowned son of sultan Iltmash (around 1230 A.D. ) is believed buried in it. That is a myth because there is no grave there. A Sanskrit inscription was also found in its ceiling. The beams of the octagonal crypt bore figures of Kamadhenu (celestial cow) and Varaha ([Lord Vishnu’s incarnation as a] wild boar). A Muslim tomb would never sport two highly detested animals. These two animals were a royal Hindu insignia. Even today five such pig-faced drain pipes may be seen projecting out of the walls of the royal pavilions inside Delhi’s Red Fort. Had Shahjahan built the fort as is currently believed he wouldn’t have had pigs peering from over his royal Islamic head since pigs are deeply detested by Islam. Contrarily the wild boar is an Hindu incarnation and sacred royal Hindu emblem. This is one of the visual proofs of the Hindu origin of Delhi’s Red Fort. So careless has been the study of Indian history that such graphic proofs have remained unnoticed. For similar more evidence read Mr. P. N. Oak’s research book titled “Delhi’s Red Fort is Hindu Lalkot.” [This photo was repeated elsewhere in the album under which was a caption that was completely different. You may want to read it as well which follows:]” [2] [3] [1] This ancient Hindu royal emblem of a wild boar (left) and the cow was found engraved on a lintel of what has been euphemistically called Sultan Ghari four miles from the Kutab Minar in Delhi. This proves that the so-called tomb was originally a Hindu palace. Like thousands of other buildings throughout India that palace too was pressed into Muslim use. Sultan Altmash’s son is believed to be buried there. Yet the tomb is not known after him but merely as the “Sultan’s Cavern.” Scholars have been wrong in believing that the building was built after the prince’s death. All such mediaeval tombs and mosques are erstwhile Hindu palaces and temples. That is why their decor is entirely Hindu. Historians and archaeologists hard put to explain away Hindu decor of what they believed to be Muslim buildings improvised the absurd justification that the building must have been fashioned out of the debris of some Hindu buildings or that the workmen being Hindu built in the Hindu style. Both these arguments are wrong. No building worth its name can be built out of debris. Similarly no workman ever dare or would ever care to fashion a building for which he is hired according to his own taste opposed to that of the owner’s. In this case the lintel was plastered over when the building was used as a Muslim tomb because the Islamic conscience cannot tolerate idolatrous images. Such tactics were used by Muslim invaders in all lands they overran when making use of captured buildings. A Sanskrit inscription was also found in the roof of the building. The building is octagonal in shape which is also a Hindu specialty. This royal Hindu emblem and another found in the Red Fort in Delhi stress the need for historians to look for and collect all such ancient Hindu royal emblems. This is a very enchanting and engrossing task that faces all those who are interested in rewriting Indian history after a millennium of Islam distortion and destruction.

The temple was rebuilt by the Ganga dynasty king Anantavarman Chodaganga in the 12th century CE as proposed by the Kendupatna copper-plate inscription of his descendant Narasimhadeva II. Anantavarman was originally a Shaivite and became a Vaishnavite sometime after he conquered the Utkala region (in which the temple is located) in 1112 CE. An 1134–1135 CE inscription records his donation to the temple. Therefore the temple structure must have started sometime after 1112 CE.According to a story in the temple chronicles it was founded by Anangabhima-deva II: different chronicles variously mention the year of construction as 1196 1197 1205 1216 or 1226. This suggests that the temple's construction was completed or that the temple was renovated during the reign of Anantavarman's son Anangabhima. The temple complex was further developed during the reigns of the subsequent kings including those of the Ganga dynasty and the Gajapati dynasty,Utkarsh Bitla,https://www.quora.com/profile/Utkarsh-Bitla

Therefore dedicating all actions on Ishvara(Lord) will make you free from lust greed and anger. “All action is entirely done by the Gunas (qualities) of Prakriti(nature). Man deluded by the sense of ‘I’ thinks ‘I am the doer’.”—Bhagavad Gita Chapter3 Shloka 27 2. One should remember that it is action (Karma) that creates everything. Therefore without being lazy one must perform it’s allotted task with an undivided mind. “Do your allotted task; for action is superior to inaction; with inaction even life’s normal course is not possible’’ —Bhagavad Gita. Chapter3 Shloka 8 3. Inner Discipline makes you strong. One should not sway with his roaming senses and eat whatever his tongue tastes good sleep whenever his desires force him and reproduce impelled by lust. One must act wisely with these things so that he will remain unaffected by tragedies. “To him who is disciplined in food and recreation in effort in all activities and in sleep and waking Yoga (Discipline) becomes a relief from all ills.”—Bhagavad Gita Chapter6 Shloka 17 4. Always have faith in Ishvara(Supreme personality). Ishvara(Lord) dwells in faith. You can not live without faith whether your faith is that you don’t have faith in Ishvara(Lord) still Ishvara(Supreme Personality of Godhead) shall be with you in the way you desire. Surrendering to Ishvara(Lord) shall give you strength in performing your Karma. “ Whatever form one desires to worship in faith and devotion in that very form I make that faith of his secure’—Bhagavad Gita Chapter7 Shloka 21 5. One should try to consume the food that comes from plant sources. Plants are the ones who have the strength to consume the energy from the sun. Like a Yogi they are constant and consuming their energy shall nourish your mind with the strength of Ishvara( Lord). Avoid hurting all innocent animals. “Victuals that add to one’s years vitality strength health happiness and appetite; are savory rich substantial and inviting are dear to sattvika”—Bhagavad Gita Chapter 17 Shloka 8 6. When your life becomes a burden on you do not give up. This is the time for the ‘Mahabharata war’. Forget that this life is yours. Fight against all sorrows stress and pain it sends against you. If you overcome(slay) all those pain sufferings and misery in your life you shall attain success (Earth/a position you want/ material success). But in case you get failed you will have no regret but you shall feel the heavenly joy as you had fought without desiring anything. “O Kaunteya! Slain you shall gain heaven; victorious you shall inherit the earth: therefore arise determined to fight”—Bhagavad Gita Chapter2 Shloka 37 7. Most often your taste smell feelings and all sensual activities will try to drive you away from your goal. Remember that it’s the Maya(illusion). Therefore it is wise to not to come under the roaming senses. “For when his mind runs after any of the roaming senses it sweeps away his understanding as the wind a vessel upon the water”—Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2 Shloka 67 8. You have not seen the future. Even you do not know what will happen after a while. But you always are worried about it. Remember action is only in your hand and the fruit(result) of the action is not. For each action there is a result therefore why to think about results? It will certainly take some efforts and your efforts will be divided. You will not be able to perform a task with complete devotion. Hence perform your Karma without desiring the fruit as each action has a fruit. “Action alone is thy province never the fruits thereof; let not your motive be the fruit of action nor should you desire to avoid action”— Bhagavad Gita Chapter2 Shloka 47 9. You might read all the books gain all the knowledge. You might practice all the skills but they shall not bring peace. The only thing that can bring peace is the renunciation of the fruit of all actions. Don’t be worried about thinking what will happen but live in the moment of your present. Why be worried about something that has no existence? “Better is Knowledge than practice better than knowledge is concentration better than concentration is the renunciation of the fruit of all actions(Karma) from which directly issues peace”—Bhagavad Gita Chapter 12 Shloka 12 10.All the things that you consider Knowledge is nothing but the manifestations of the self. Therefore the only knowledge that you should try to gain is the knowledge of the self(Atman). “There is nothing in this world so purifying as knowledge(Self). He who is perfected by Yoga finds it in himself in the fullness of time’’—Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4 Shloka 38,Biswajit Mohanty,https://www.quora.com/profile/Biswajit-Mohanty-74

The Navagrahas emanate superb radiant energy (which does exist in all temples everywhere but the Navagraha-energy is very vibrant) which travels back and forth from them to the temple’s main kalasha as all the energies do. Then unlike the rest (most) of the energies the Navagraha-energy which came from one Navagraha eventually ends up in another Navagraha. In short the energy from deity A. after bouncing back from the kalasha goes to deity B. not deity A. By travelling 9 times around the Planetary deities one absorbs the energy of a deity given out by another deity. This receiving is indirect unlike the direct receiving of energy from the main god/goddess of the temple. Hence in order to receive indirect energies after receiving direct energies one must follow the order of first main deity then the Navagrahas. The reason for the order: first direct receiving then indirect receiving is very complicated and requires the audience to know about how divine energy is transmitted in various ways.The rest of the deities must be worshipped in between order doesn’t matter. You can go first Shiva then Durga or first Durga then Shiva. Sometimes people actually do not care who goes first and worship the surrounding deities (for ex. Durga Shiva etc.) then main deity (ex. Muruga). So people actually like that sometimes worship the non-main deity then the main deity. But 3 things are clear as a summary:Ganesh first if there is a place to worship him and if it is a Shaivite templeDon’t forget to worship the main deity… :)Navagrahas go last if there is a place for them,Iniyan Achyudhan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Iniyan-Achyudhan

Śiva rejoiced at the perfect devotion of Viṣṇu. In an auspicious hour the great lord made Viṣṇu sit on the exquisite throne and delightedly decorated him in every way. A beautiful coronet was fixed on Viṣṇu and the auspicious holy thread was tied to his waist. He was then coronated by lord Śiva in the Cosmic Hall.(3) CONCLUSION What is the conclusion? If God is willing to position a devotee higher than His own position there is no answer as to who is superior between the two. For Śaiva Viṣṇu is Siva's favorite devotee. And for Vaiṣṇava Siva is Lord Viṣṇu's favorite devotee. They complement each other. Why do we only compare the two based on their greatness than of their generosity? Hari-Hara are 2 of Lord's most generous personalities.Mārkaṇḍeya Ṛṣi on Mahābhārata Harivaṃśa :—I offer my salutation to Śiva in the form of Viṣṇu and Viṣṇu in the form of Śiva. I find no difference between the two. Observing my feelings let both of them bestow welfare on me. Lord Viṣṇu cannot exist without Śiva and Śiva cannot exist without Viṣṇu. Therefore in the earlier times both of them had unified personality. I offer my salutation to lord Rudra and Viṣṇu who roam about in the world individually or collectively.An ancient Ārca of Harihara in Indonesia.

It is a UNESCO world heritage site and icon of Cambodia. The Angkor Wat consist of hundreds of stone temples and remains of the Khmer empire. This largest temple complex was built in 12th century by Khmer king Suryavarman II. Angkor Wat was originally dedicated to Lord Vishnu and later it became a Buddhist complex. Unlike other Hindu temples Angkor Wat faces the West. Archaeologists believed that Angkor Wat is not only a temple but also a mausoleum. The skilled workers of Saurvarman only used sandstones as main material for the construction of the largest religious complex. The Angkor Wat is actually a portrayal of sacred mountain mount Meru. The center tower of the temple stands at a height of 65 meters is surrounded by four smaller towers. The main entrance of the Angkor Wat on West side has rich decorations with sculptures and carvings. There is also a 3.2 meters high statue of Lord Vishnu made of sandstone. The central complex of Angkor Wat is a three storey structure. There are three main galleries in the central complex of the temple. Each gallery also has a lotus-bud shaped tower. The gallery of thousands Buddha houses hundreds of images of Lord Buddha. The inner wall of Angkor Wat is also decorated with important scenes from Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata.,Savrabh Mishra,https://www.quora.com/profile/Savrabh-Mishra

Todar Mall was the Minister under reign of Akbar who did land reforms in Orissa. They were all Hindu kings under Akbar and did not harm the temple. But during reign of Jahangir and Shahjahan attack on the temple increased and temple treasures were looted. In fact this was happening through out India as pilgrims donated huge funds to the temple management by way of offering to deity. But things were managed and worship of Lord Jagannath didnot stop till 1682 during the reign of Emperor Aurangzeb. From 1682 to 1707 Lord Jagannath was hidden and Rath Yatra was stopped for 25 years till the end of rule by Aurangzeb. After him Moghul rule became weak and Maratthas and British Rule were established. Some how the temple survived various assults on it. The local Kings and the temple priests had their role in preserving the temple in tact. Possibly the local Muslim rulers might have spared the temple after looting the treasure. Even some Odia Kings accepted Islam to protect Lord Jagannath. Most notable King of Khurda Shri Rama Chandra Dev converted himself to Islam to protect his kingdom and renamed him as Hafiz Kader. In a remarkable decision the Mukti Mandap allowed him to sweep the Chariots during Rath Yatra even after conversion to Islam. From that day Shri Jagannath became Patita Paban and the Islam converted Khurda King could worship him from Singha Dwara instead of entering into the temple. As a rule Muslims and Christians are not allowed to the Puri Temple till date. It would be incomplete if we not mention the name of Sal Begh who was a great devotee of Lord Jagannath. He was a son of Lal Begh a Moghul Subedar in Odisha and influenced Moghuls in not damaging the Puri Temple. The grave of Sal Begh is situated in Puri town and the car of Lord Jagannath stops for a while during Rath Yatra even today. During British time there was no interference in the Temple affairs and we see the Puri temple as it is today.,Matruprasad Mishra,https://www.quora.com/profile/Matruprasad-Mishra

This form called a vigraha (‘form’) or murti (‘crystallization’) is usually called an idol or icon in English.Importantly Hindus don’t ‘worship idols’ believing the physical objects to literally be supernatural Gods in and of themselves. It is not at all clear to me that anyone in the history of the world’s cultures has ever done that; it seems to me that that is an ignorant caricature of ‘idol worship’ largely made up by those who wished to criticize it making a fallacious strawman argument. Certainly that is true in the case of Hindus. Any object natural or human-made can be used for worship by Hindus because Brahman is in all objects. Whatever helps a worshipper connect their consciousness to Brahman whatever tool or prop or medium works well for them they can use it be it a carven idol or a tree or a cow or the sun or the air itself. Similarly it’s not that Hindus ascribe great supernatural magical powers to the tree or to the cow. What we are doing is recognizing and communing with the Divine Spirit that pervades all things. Idols are great tools for many Hindus because they very concretely embody and represent our beloved Divine forms and let devotees easily and naturally connect our consciousness to that Divinity feel Its presence and commune with It in an engaged and stable way.,Devala Rees,https://www.quora.com/profile/Devala-Rees

He says it's not Chitragupta but Chittagupta (chitta = mind soul…..depends on how you want to call it). It's your soul keeping track of your words and deeds omissions and commissions. So it's not an actual guy writing down what you do in your life but it's your soul keeping track of it. And you reap what you sow.

Lord vishnu got pleased by his tapasya and asked him for his wish. Then that devotee said “ I want Lakshmi as my wife” and as per the norm once god gets pleased by a devotee he has to give him what he wants. So lord vishnu assured him that he will get Lakshmi as his wife in his next birth. Little did he know that he was dealing with lord vishnu. In his next birth goddess Lakshmi took 4 reincarnations as rukhminisatyabhamaJambavanti and radha. Radha and krishna are their soulmates from their childhood days. She was mad in love with krishna but ultimately both of them knew why Lakshmi got incarnated as radha so to fulfill that deed she has to marry ayan in spite of loving krishna. But there is a twist though vishnu gave him vardan to marry Lakshmi  she is the eternal love of vishnu she can't divulge with anyone else. So ayan took birth as a hijda(transgender or impotent). Though they were married they could never become one. Radha’s love for krishna didn't die even after marriage and they both loved each other and met with each other. Though radha physically stayed with ayan her heart always belonged to her love krishna. Once her husband ayan saw her going to the jungle and doubted may be because he is impotent radha is having an extra marital affair. So one day he followed radha along with some people to see where she actually goes. Krishna already came to know about that and took the form of kali(as ayan was a devotee of kali) to save radha from the image of an unfaithful wife. Such was their love.Just notice the style of standing in one and half legs and the blue color. Everyone including ayan could see she is praying to goddess kali only radha could see krishna. This form of krishnakali is still worshipped in many parts of our country. Though krishna couldn't marry radha he said krishna is incomplete without radha so till the time of eternity they will always be together. There name will always be taken together worshipped together.krishna married the other 3 reincarnations of Lakshmi. ultimately he had the whole of Lakshmi(all the four forms).= I know this much only.

RelatedWhat are drum skins made of?,https://www.quora.com/What-are-drum-skins-made-of,,Today Mylar. In the 1950s Remo Belli Bill Ludwig and Marion I. “Chick” Evans were all experimenting with the Mylar heads. Evans completed a Mylar version drumhead that consisted of a drilled outer hoop that tacked a Mylar head to a smaller inner hoop. Didn’t work great. I don’t know if many of you know this but William Ludwig Remo Belli and Chick Evans were touring drummers early in their career. Funny but we drummers have been buying these drums and heads forever not even realizing that actual drummers started out the companies. Remo Belli (love that name I want it) ) and Dan Muchnick came upon a successful way to put the Mylar heads on hoops with glue which led to the development of the Remo Drumhead Company. Remo drum heads are still used today of course. But then again so are Evans. Mylar is polyethylene terephthalate due to its strong nature and resistance to moisture heat and sunlight. Polyethylene terephthalate is composed of chemical compounds -ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid substances derived from petroleum. So that’s what today’s drum heads are made of. From Way More Sound —- ‘Single-ply Mylar (PET) is the most commonly used polymer drumhead. Double-ply PET or Kevlar is good for louder styles from R&B to Rock. Animal Hide or Synthetic Calfskin may be preferred for Jazz. CLEAR HEADS are brighter with more attack. COATED heads are warmer for snare and bass drums.’ (Me again) Drum heads before that were made of animal skins usually cow and calf skin. While the Mylar head does not usually lose its tension with atmospheric changes it does break after awhile much quicker then the old calf skins which at times lasted nearly forever. However due to conditions of the weather the skins would get affected. When drummers using cowhide heads would play at gigs in places that had air conditioning they would bring spray bottles of water and spray the skins every so often so they wouldn’t dry out and change sound. I never knew that. Can you imagine owning Gene Krupa’s spray bottle? You can find old drums now and then that still have their cowhide or calf skin heads intact. Some drummers today are going back to the actual skin drum heads especially jazz drummers and some companies are now making these skins for drummers. It’s a long hard process so these actual skins are pricy. Companies like AK Drums Buchler Trommelbau and Kentville Drums are offering goat calf and kangaroo (hear that Reese?) hide drumheads respectively. Some of the big drum head companies are also selling calf and goat skin drum heads including my favourite outfit Evans. Also Remo puts out drum heads called Fibreskin for certain hand drums. Hand drummers want skins on their drums not Mylar. Some drum heads are now made from Kevlar especially the marching drum heads. Bulletproof? So that’s it. By the way you drummers out there there is a great podcast called Drum History and it’s host is a very amiable man named Bart Van der Zee. It’s a fantastic podcast all about drums drumming equipment etc. Everything you want to know about drums. The last show I listened to was all about cowhide heads how they are made what’s good about them and all kinds of fascinating information. I used a little of it in my answer here so tune into this guy you won’t regret it. Very easy guy to listen to and he knows what he’s talking about. Well that’s it for me. Thanks for reading friends. Below the sound of cowhide drum heads. Bloody nice. Seem to give a deeper tone. Maybe I should start saving up better yet Christmas is coming. My wife will soon ask me “Honey what do you want for Christmas this year?” “ANIMAL SKINS!”This guy is very good. Nice tasty good sounding drumming. I included a podcast from Drum History about the History of Slingerland Drums. Now I started with Ludwigs then went on to Slingerland and I found that I did not care for the Slingerland tom sounds as much as I liked the Ludwigs however Slingerland a five piece kit though I used a Ludwig Supraphonic 400 snare were the drums I would use in the studio. I didn’t mind them but found they were probably better for jazz than rock. I then toured with a nine piece Pearl kit. Again I found the toms were not as nice as Ludwig but what the hell. Now one of my sons has the Slingerland kit and the other has the Pearl kit. I use DW now love them. Hope you like it. I got a kick out of this podcast. Gotta go now and finish my Scotch and cigar. Later dudes keep your sticks on the drums.,R J Holland,https://www.quora.com/profile/R-J-Holland

The two major versions are Northern and Southern Recensions. The first English translation was carried out by Kishori Mohan Ganguly in the 1880s and this remains the first English translation of the Mahabharata. The Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI) have undertaken the arduous task of establishing the most authentic version of the Mahabharata by painstakingly removing all inner contradictions. They have taken all available versions across all recensions to arrive at this version.
