He found that the Lord was meditating His eyes closed hands drawn onto His knees and an expression of perpetual bliss on His face.When the Lord finally opened His eyes He asked Narada for the reason of visit. Narada asked “Oh Lord I have this question from a very long time. Whenever I come to see You You are always meditating. What is it You are meditating about all the time?” The Lord smiled and answered “I meditate on my dearest Lord Narayana. There is not one moment when I'm not thinking about my Lord. He lives in my heart and I worship Him every instance of time.” Narada then went straight to Vaikuntha where He saw Lord Vishnu lying in eternal tranquility on the bed of Adishesha serpernt. The Lord was in yoganidra state seeming to worship someone. Narada mesmerized by that sight asked “Oh Lord whenever I come to see You You are always in a blissful meditative state of yoganidra. What is it that You are thinking about all the time?” A pleasant smile got spread across Lord's face and He said “Oh great sage Narada it is my dearest Lord Shiva Who I always think about Who I always meditate upon. My Lord occupies my heart like the sunlight occupies the daytime skies.” That is why in Yajurveda we find following shloka. शिवाय विष्णु रूपाय शिव रूपाय विष्णवे |शिवस्य हृदयं विष्णुं विष्णोश्च हृदयं शिवः || यथा शिवमयो विष्णुरेवं विष्णुमयः शिवः |यथाsन्तरम् न पश्यामि तथा में स्वस्तिरायुषि|यथाsन्तरं न भेदा: स्यु: शिवराघवयोस्तथा|| It means that Shiva is nothing but Vishnu and Vishnu is nothing but Shiva. Vishnu lives in the heart of Shiva while Shiva occupies the heart of Vishnu. Just like Vishnu contains Shiva Shiva contains Vishnu. “Bring them to me those who forget this eternal unity” is said by Yama. A person will be safe and long living only if he doesn't find differences in Shiva and Vishnu. Lord Shiva is seen sitting on tiger's hide signifies His mastery and full control over animalistic qualities such as Greed Lust Ignorance and Anger etc. It also signifies that the Lord is Pashupati the Lord of all the animals. Om Namah Shivaya. 🙏🙏

But if you see everything as equal then their would be no war etc. No greed etc. Too. The worship lets the worshipper focus the mind and remind him that everything is fundamental propert. Its just its kinda different method. Actually same is the reasoe Hindus worship idols. Since the ultimate reality can't be understood by mind so we assume that Ultimate reality in an idol and worship it. To understand what I have written.

Do I really need words to demolish the twig towers his fantastic imagination !!? How are these claims less ridiculous than apologists for the Aryan Invasion Theory ? Who despite evidence to the contrary claim that agriculture was invented in the region of modern day Turkey and gifted to India by Turkish tribes who “visited” India; stayed here for a few years – like modern day tourists – and then went back !!? Nobody denies that the rituals symbols and stories of India flowed from a Brahmanical society established by yogis and mystics. But to deny the possibility of enlightenment/nirvana and go on about Brahmanical patriarchy would be to claim that the British came to India not for the gold but for the noble purpose of civilizing a fallen society. Of course the instability & neurosis of his brilliantly imaginative mind doesn't leave any room for doubt about his fantastical beliefs!

His mother was Devki and father Vasudev. The Puranic legend is the earth was burdened with heinous sins of demons in Dwaparyuga especially with Kansa the brother of Devki. To end that tyranny Lord Vishnu blessed mother Earth who sought his blessings and took birth as Krishna. Kansa was told by fortune tellers that the eighth child of Devki will bring him to death during the wedding of Devki and Vasudev an either voice warned Kansa of same due to which he imprisoned both and arranged to kill all the sons of his dear sister Devki and brother-in-law Vasudev. When Krishna Ji (Lord Vishnu) was born in jail with the blessing of the divine power (Divine-Leela) Vasudev Ji secretly carried the infant Krishna Ji took him to Gokul by crossing the overflowing river Yamuna and exchanged him with the girl child of Yashoda and Nandi Baba. The exchanged girl child appeared as goddess Durga (Maya) and warned Kansa that the son of Devki who will kill him is born she then disappeared. Fearful Kansa attempted many times thereafter to kill Lord Krishna. He grew in Vrindavan with his foster parents Yashoda & Nandibaba. Subhadra was his sister and Balram was his brother. knowledge of Holy Shrimad Bhagavad Gita There are numerous verses to consider from Srimad Bhagavad Gita which prove there is some other Supreme God about whom the narrator of Gita Ji (seeming to be Shri Krishna Ji) refers. Let us study them to understand who delivered the knowledge of Holy Srimad Bhagavad Gita. Brahm (Kaal) had pledged that he would never appear before anyone in his original form. He is the narrator of the Holy Gita. Gita Adhyay 11 Shlok 32 By entering into Shri Krishan Ji's body like a ghost Kaal is saying \"Arjun I am an enlarged Kaal. I have appeared now to eat all the loks”. Gita Adhyay 7 Shlok 25 the giver of the knowledge of Bhagavad Gita ie. Kaal says: Arjun I remain hidden with my yog-maya (mystic powers) I do not come in front of anyone. This is my bad (cheap) firm rule this is my incorruptible rule. Foolish people not knowing my bad ie. Inferior eternal main character consider the unmanifested / invisible me as having come in human form i.e. I am not Krishna. Gita Adhyay 11 Shlok 47 Speaker of Gita-Kaal says This is my actual Kaal form. Nobody can see this ie. attain Brahm by any method mentioned in the Vedas or by jap tap or by any other activity. This proves that the speaker of pious Gita Ji is not Lord Krishna but someone else (Kaal / Brahm) who says ‘I am an enlarged Kaal’. He counsels Arjun to fight the battle imparts knowledge and describes who is the Supreme God? who should be worshipped by devotees to attain eternal world and supreme peace ie. salvation. Various slokas of Holy Gita this Kaal-God (giver of the knowledge of pious Gita Ji) glorifies the Master of Lineage the creator of the universe the Supreme God. Let us review the dialogues held in the battlefield in Kurukshetra during the war of Mahabharata between Kaal/Brahm and the warrior Arjun. Arjun had refused to fight the battle realizing the catastrophic aftermaths of the war. At that time Kaal entered into the body of Lord Krishna like a ghost and provokes him to fight.

You in every respect go in the refuge of only that Supreme God. By the grace of that Supreme God you will attain the supreme peace and will attain the eternal abode – Satlok (place-dhaam)” Krishann g died by an arrow which was shot by a hunter thinking that padam in krishan ji's foot is eye of a deer. It is said that hunter was rebirt of Bali who came to take his revenge. It is to think when these gods cant be spared from kramas how can we.

Pashupati Nath means Lord to all animals here Lord to animals means the God to the animal instincts in us too. When we surrender to Him He will relieve us from all the gunas or qualities and dissolves us into Him. The Pashupatinath temple is one of the biggest temples of Shiva located on the banks of the Bagmati Rover in the eastern part of Kathmandu the capital city of Nepal.The temple is listed in UNESCO World Heritage Sites list.There are many temples dedicated to other Gods in the temple complex which include Vaishnav temple Ram temple from the 14 th century and Guhyeshwari temple mentioned in an 11 th century manuscript.It is regarded as the most sacred among the temples of Shiva.Kotirudra Samhita chapter 11 on the Shivlingas of the north in Shiva Purana mention this Shivlinga as the bestower of all wishes.On the important festival of Maha Shivratri the temple is flooded with nearly 1 million devotees.According to Nepal Mahatmaya and Himavatkhanda the diety here gained fame and is dated back to 400 ADThe Shakti Peetha of Mata Sati is located near to the Pashupati Nath temple.Story of Pashupati Nath ::One day Shiva and Parvathi came to Kathmandu Valley and rested by the Bagmati River while on a journey.It is believed that Shiva and Parvathi were impressed by its scenic beauty that they transformed themselves into deers and walked into the forest.Meanwhile All Gods were searching for Shiva and last found Him in deer form and they requested Shiva to return back to Khailash.After much persuading Shiva agreed to return. But since Shiva lived by the bagmati in a deer’s form He would now be known as Pashupathi nath Lord of all animals. And Shiva manifested himself into a Linga there.It is a popular belief that whoever comes here and beheld the lingam here he would never be born as an animal.It is said that the wish fulfilling Cow Kamadhenu took shelter in a cave in the near by Chandravan mountainEvery day Kamadhenu Cow went down to the place where the Lingam was sunken into the soil and poured her milk on the top of the soil.After 10000 years some people who saw this incident were surprised and they removed the soil only to see the Shivlinga. When the people touched the Lingam they disappeared into the Lingam and thus attained liberation.Thus many people started to attain moksha and this was a concern for Lord Brahma the creator.Later after few centuries a temple was constructed for the Linga. In Which year exactly the temple was constructed  still remains a controversy.Reconstruction of the temple was done again in 17 th century by Nepal King.

Later after the muslims captured it they - as usual tried destroying it by camouflaging it and making it like a makbara. If you don’t believe in it Here are the proofs with photographs. Look at it without any biases that you might have been fed with since long and you will know the truth. This presents photographs (listed below) that show the Vedic influence found in such buildings as the Taj Mahal Red Fort and other structures in India. In fact as recently as 1910 the Encyclopedia Brittanica also said that it was a pre-existing building before Shah Jahan. It is because of the manipulation of history by invaders that the true greatness of India and Vedic culture has been stifled or hidden. And it is time that people everywhere realize how numerous lies and false propaganda have been passed around as if it were the truth in regard to India and its past as well as its art archeology and the wonder of its culture. Descriptions of the Photographs of the Taj MahalPhoto # 1: “An aerial view of the Taj Mahal alias Tejo Mahalaya ancient Hindu temple complex in Agra. For the last 300 years the world has been fooled to believe that this stupendous edifice was built by the 5th generation Mogul emperor Shahjahan to commemorate one of his dead wives–Mumtaz. The two flanking buildings although identical only the one in the rear is known as a mosque. The Taj Mahal has seven stories. Five of them lie sealed and barred concealing rich evidence. The marble building in the centre is flanked by two symmetrical ones. The one in the foreground is the eastern one. The one in the background is being represented as a mosque because it is to the west. They should not have been identical if only one was to be a mosque. In the courtyard at the foot of the eastern building is inlaid a full scale replica of the trident pinnacle [found at the top of the dome]. The tiny tower at the left near the western building encloses a huge octagonal multi-storied well.”[1]Photo # 2: “This is the massive octagonal well with palatial apartments along its seven stories. A royal staircase descends right down to the water level indicated by the tiny white patch showing the sun’s reflection. This was the traditional treasury well of the Hindu temple palace. Treasure chests used to be stacked in the lower stories. Accountants cashiers and treasurers sat in the upper stories. Cheques called handies used to be issued from here. On being besieged if the building had to be surrendered to the enemy the treasure used to be pushed into the water for salvage later after recapture. For real research water should be pumped out of this well to reveal the evidence that lies at the bottom. This well is inside a tower near the so-called mosque to the west of the marble Taj. Had the Taj been a mausoleum this octagonal multistoried well would have been superfluous.” [1] [2]Photo # 3: “A frontal view of the Taj Mahal alias Tejo Mahalaya in Agra. It is octagonal because the Hindus believe in 10 directions. The pinnacle pointing to the heaven and the foundation to the nether world plus the eight surface directions make the 10 directions. Divinity and royalty are believed to hold sway in all those 10 directions. Hence in Hindu tradition buildings connected with royalty and divinity must have some octagonal features or the buildings themselves should be octagonal. The two flanking cupolas (two others to the rear are not seen in this photo) are also identical. The towers at the four plinth corners served as watch towers during the day and to hold lights at night. Hindu wedding altars and Satyanarayan worship altars invariably have such towers at corners. [Many other Hindu temples such as those at Khajurao also can be found to have four towers or temples one at each corner of the temple foundation.] The lotus flower cap on the head of the dome is a Hindu feature. Muslim domes are bald. This marble edifice has four stories. Inside the dome is an 83 ft. high hall. The Taj has a double dome. The dome one sees from inside ends like an inverted pan on the terrace. The dome seen from outside is a cover on the inner dome. Therefore in between them is an 83 ft. hall. This may be considered as one storey. Underneath may be seen the first storey arches and the ground floor rooms. In the basement visitors are shown one room. All these constitute the four storeys in the marble edifice. Below the marble structure are two stories in red stone reaching down to the river level. The 7th storey must be below the river level because every ancient Hindu historic building did have a basement. Thus the Taj is a seven-storied structure.” [1] [2]Photo # 4: “The dome of the Taj Mahal bearing a trident pinnacle made of a non-rusting eight-metal Hindu alloy. The pinnacle served as a lightning deflector too. This pinnacle has been blindly assumed by many to be an Islamic crescent and star or a lightning conductor installed by the British. This is a measure of the careless manner in which Indian history has been studied till now. Visually identifiable things like this pinnacle too have been misinterpreted with impunity. The flower top of the dome below the pinnacle is an unmistakable Hindu sign. A full scale figure of this pinnacle is inlaid in the eastern courtyard.”[1] [2]Photo # 5: “A close up of the upper portion of the pinnacle of the Taj Mahal photographed from the parapet beneath the dome. The Hindu horizontal crescent and the coconut top together look like a trident from the garden level. Islamic crescents are always oblique. Moreover they are almost always complete circles leaving a little opening for a star. This Hindu pinnacle had all these centuries been misinterpreted as an Islamic crescent and star or a lightning conductor installed by the British. The word “Allah” etched here by Shahjahan is absent in the courtyard replica. The coconut the bent mango leaves under it and the supporting Kalash (water pot) are exclusive Hindu motifs.”[1]Photo # 6: “The full scale figure of the pinnacle on the dome has been inlaid on the red stone courtyard of the Taj Mahal. One may see it to the east at the foot of the riverside arch of the flanking building wrongly dubbed as Jamiat Khana (community hall) by Muslim usurpers. Such floor sketches in courtyards are a common Hindu trait. In Fatehpur Sikri it is the backgammon board which is sketched on a central courtyard. The coconut top and the bent mango leaves underneath resting on a kalash (i.e. a water pot) is a sacred Hindu motif. Hindu shrines in the Himalayan foothills have identical pinnacles [especially noticed at Kedarnath a prominent Shiva temple]. The eastern location of the sketch is also typically Hindu. The length measures almost 32 ft.” [1]Photo # 7: “The apex of the lofty entrance arch on all four sides of the Taj Mahal bears this red lotus and white trident–indicating that the building originated as a Hindu temple. The Koranic lettering forming the middle strip was grafted after Shahjahan seized the building from Jaipur state’s Hindu ruler.” [1]Photo # 8: “This is a riverside view of the Taj Mahal. The four storied marble structure above has under it these two stories reaching down to the river level. The 22 rooms shown in other photos are behind that line of arches seen in the middle. Each arch is flanked by Hindu lotus discs in white marble. Just above the ground level is the plinth. In the left corner of the plinth is a doorway indicating inside the plinth are many rooms sealed by Shahjahan. One could step out to the river bank from the door at the left. The 7th storey is surmised to be under the plinth below the ground because every ancient Hindu mansion had a basement. Excavation to reach the basement chamber should start under this door.” [1]Photo # 9: “Most people content to see Mumtaz’s grave inside the Taj fail to go to the rear riverside. This is the riverside view. From here one may notice that the four-storied marble structure on top has below it two more stories in red stone. Note the window aperture in the arch at the left. That indicates that there are rooms inside. Inside the row of arches in the upper part of the wall are 22 rooms. In addition to the four stories in marble this one shows red stone arches in the 5th storey. The 6th storey lies in the plinth in the lower portion of the photo. In another photo a doorway would be seen in the left corner of the plinth indicating the presence of apartments inside from where one could emerge on the river for a bath.” [1]Photo # 10: “These corridors at the approach of the Taj Mahal are typically Hindu. They may be seen in any ancient Hindu capital. Note the two octagonal tower cupolas at the right and left top. Only Hindus have special names for the eight directions and celestial guards assigned to each. Any octagonal feature in historic buildings should convince the visitor of their Hindu origin. Guards palanquin bearers and other attendants resided in hundreds of rooms along numerous such corridors when the Taj Mahal was a Hindu temple palace. Thus the Taj was more magnificent and majestic before it was reduced to a sombre Islamic cemetery.” [1] [2]Photo # 11: “This Naqqar Khana alias Music House in the Taj Mahal garden is an incongruity if the Taj Mahal were an Islamic tomb. Close by on the right is the building which Muslims claim to be a mosque. The proximity of a mosque to the Music House is incongruous with Muslim tradition. In India Muslims have a tradition of pelting stones on Hindu music processions passing over a mosque. Moreover a mausoleum needs silence. A dead person’s repose is never to be disturbed. Who would then provide a band house for a dead Mumtaz? Contrarily Hindu temples and palaces have a music house because morning and evening Hindu chores begin to the sweet strains of sacred music.” [1]Photo # 12: “Such are the rooms on the 1st floor of the marble structure of the Taj Mahal. The two staircases leading to this upper floor are kept locked and barred since Shahjahan’s time. The floor and the marble walls of such upper floor rooms can be seen in the picture to have been stripped of its marble panels. Shahjahan used that uprooted marble from the upper floor for constructing graves and engraving the Koran because he did not know wherefrom to procure marble matching the splendour of the rest of the Taj Mahal. He was also so stingy as not to want to spend much even on converting a robbed Hindu temple into an Islamic mausoleum.” [1] [2]Photo # 13: “Such are the magnificent marble-paved shining cool white bright rooms of the Taj Mahal temple palace’s marble ground floor. Even the lower third portion of the walls is covered with magnificent marble mosaic. The doorway at the left looks suspiciously closed with a stone slab. One can perambulate through these rooms around the central octagonal sanctorum now occupied by Mumtaz’s fake grave. The aperture seen through of the central door enabled perambulating devotees to keep their eyes fixed on the Shiva Linga in the central chamber. Hindu Shiva Lingas are consecrated in two chambers one above the other. Therefore Shahjahan had to raise two graves in the name of Mumtaz–one in the marble basement and the other on the ground floor to desecrate and hide both the Shiva emblems from public view. [The famous Shiva temple in Ujjain also has an underground chamber for one of its Shiva-lingams.]” [1] [2]Photo # 14: “This is the Dhatura flower essential for Hindu Shiva worship. The flower is depicted in the shape of the sacred esoteric Hindu incantation ‘OM.’ Embossed designs of this blooming ‘OM’ are drawn over the exterior of the octagonal central sanctorum of Shiva where now a fake grave in Mumtaz’s has been planted. While perambulating around the central chamber one may see such ‘OM’ designs.” [1]Photo # 15: “This staircase and another symmetrical one at the other end lead down to the storey beneath the marble platform. Visitors may go to the back of the marble plinth at the eastern or western end and descend down the staircase because it is open to the sky. But at the foot the archaeology department has set up an iron door which it keeps locked. Yet one may peep inside from the iron gate in the upper part of the door. Shahjahan had sealed even these two staircases. It was the British who opened them. But from Shahjahan’s time the stories below and above the marble ground floor have been barred to visitors. We are still following Mogul dictates though long free from Mogul rule.” [1]Photo # 16: “On the inner flank of the 22 locked rooms (in the secret storey in red stone below the marble platform) is this corridor about 12 ft. broad and 300 ft. long. Note the scallop design at the base of the plinth supporting the arches. This is the Hindu decoration which enables one to identify even a bare plinth.” [1]Photo # 17: “One of the 22 rooms in the secret storey underneath the marble plinth of the Taj Mahal. Many such features of the Taj remain unknown to the public so long as they see it only as a tomb. If the public knew how much it is missing in the Taj Mahal it will insist that the government unseal its many stories. Two doorways at either end of this corridor in the right side wall leading to inner apartments have been sealed by Shahjahan. If those doorways are opened important evidence concealed inside by Shahjahan may come to light.” [1]Photo # 18: “A corner of one of the 22 rooms in the secret storey immediately below the marble platform of the Taj Mahal. Note the strips of Hindu paint on the wall. The ventilator at the left meant for air and light from the riverside has been crudely walled up by Shahjahan. He did not bother even to plaster them. Had Shahjahan built the Taj as a mausoleum what was the purpose of the 22 rooms? And why are they kept locked and hidden from the public?” [1]Photo # 19: “One of the 22 locked rooms in the secret storey beneath the marble platform of the Taj Mahal. Strips of ancient Hindu paint are seen on the wall flanking the doorway. The niches above had paintings of Hindu idols obviously rubbed off by Muslim desecraters. The rooms may be seen door within door in a row. If the public knew that the Taj Mahal is a structure hiding hundreds of rooms they would insist on seeing the whole of it. At present they only peep into the grave chamber and walk away.” [1]Photo # 20: “This esoteric Hindu design is painted on the ceiling of some of the 22 locked rooms in the secret storey below the marble platform of the Taj Mahal in Agra. Had Shahjahan built the Taj Mahal he would not have kept such elaborately painted rooms sealed and barred to the public. Even now one can enter these rooms only if one can influence the archaeology department to remove the locks.” [1]Photo # 21: “A huge ventilator of one of the 22 rooms in a secret storey of the Taj is seen here crudely sealed with unplastered bricks by Shahjahan. History has been so perverted and inverted that alien Muslims like Shahjahan who spoiled damaged desecrated and destroyed historic Hindu buildings are being falsely paraded as great builders.” [1] [3]Photo # 22: “One of the 22 riverside rooms in a secret storey of the Taj Mahal unknown to the public. Shahjahan far from building the shining marble Taj wantonly disfigured it. Here he has crudely walled up a doorway. Such imperial Mogul vandalism lies hidden from the public. This room is in the red stone storey immediately below the marble platform. Indian history has been turned topsy turvy in lauding destroyers as great builders.” [1]Photo # 23: “Many such doorways of chambers in secret stories underneath the Taj Mahal have been sealed with brick and lime. Concealed inside could be valuable evidence such as Sanskrit inscriptions Hindu idols the original Hindu model of the Taj the desecrated Shiva Linga Hindu scriptures and temple equipment. Besides such sealed chambers there are many which are kept locked by the Government. The Public must raise its voice to have these opened or it should institute legal proceedings. Shree P. N. Sharma of Green Park New Delhi who peeped through an aperture in these chambers in 1934 A.D. saw a pillared hall with images carved on the pillars.” [1] [2] [3]Photo # 24: “Burharpur is a very ancient historic city on the Central Railway between Khandwa and Bhusawal junctions. Burhanpur and the nearby Asirgarh (fort) used to provide hospitality to Hindu royals proceeding north or south on pilgrimage weddings or military expeditions. Barhanpur has many magnificent mansions which are currently being described as mosques and tombs of alien Islamic invaders. This building is one such ancient Hindu royal palace captured by the Moghuls. Mumtaz died here during her 14th delivery around 1630 A.D. while she and Shahjahan were camping here. She is said to be buried in a Hindu pavilion in front of this palace.” [1]Photo # 25: “Mumtaz is supposed to be buried in this garden pavilion of the ancient Hindu palace (Ahu Mahal) 600 miles from Agra in Burhanpur. Another version says that Mumtaz’s corpse was kept here exposed to sun rain and wild beasts for six months. The date of her death the date of her removal from Burhanpur to Agra and the date of her assumed burial in the Taj Mahal are all unknown because the entire Taj Mahal-Mumtaz legend is a concoction from the beginning to end. [Mumtaz was only one of several hundred wives and women that Shahjahan kept in his harem.]” [1] [2] Descriptions of the Photographs of the Red Fort and Other Buildings in Delhi and Elsewhere in IndiaPhoto # 26: “This tablet raised inside Delhi’s Red Fort by modern archaeologists proclaims that Shahjahan (who ruled from 1628 to 1658 A.D.) built this fort from 1639 to 1648 A.D. As against this see the [next] photo of the painting of Shahjahan’s time preserved in the Bodleian Library Oxford. It depicts Shajahan receiving the Persian ambassador inside the fort in 1628 the very year of Shahjahan’s accession. Obviously the fort existed much before Shahjahan.” [1] [3]Photo # 27: “The 5th generation Mogul emperor Shahjahan is credited with having built the Red Fort in Delhi. Shahjahan ascended the throne in 1628 A.D. This contemporary painting shows him receiving the Persian ambassador in 1628 itself in the Diwan-i-Aam (Common Room) of the Red Fort itself. This painting preserved in the Bodleian Library Oxford was reproduced in the Illustrated Weekly of India (page 32) of March 14 1971. Since Shahjahan was in the fort in the year of his accession this documentary evidence disproves the notion that he built the fort. Compare with this the photo of the tablet in English raised inside the fort by the Govt. of India’s archaeology department asserting that Shahjahan built the fort during 1639-48. This is emphatic proof of Indian history having been thoroughly falsified during Muslim rule in India.” [1]Photo # 28: “The Red Fort in Delhi has in its Khas Mahal alias the King’s apartment the royal emblem of its builder King Anangoal. It consists of a pair of swords laid hilt to hilt curving upwards the sacred Hindu pot (kalash) above the hilts a lotus bud and a pair of scales of justice balanced over it. Dotted around are representations of the sun from whom Indian ruling dynasties claimed descent. At the sword points are two small conches considered sacred in Hindu tradition. Bigger conches may be seen at the left and right corners at the base. This royal Hindu insignia of the Hindu king who built Delhi’s Red Fort is still there in the Khas Mahal pavilion. But even this visual symbol has been blatantly misinterpreted. The two swords laid hilt to hilt curving upward are being inadvertently styled by ignorant guides archaeologists and historians as an Islamic crescent. The sacred Hindu Kalash (water pot) on the hilts is never noticed. The lotus bud on the kalash represents royal wealth. The pair of scales is symbolic of impartial justice.” [1]Photo # 29: “This perforated marble screen inside the Khas Mahal (i.e. the King’s own chamber) in Delhi’s Red Fort is a Hindu specialty. Such jalees are mentioned even in Ramayanic descriptions of palaces. Therefore some buildings claimed to be mosques in Ahmedabad which boast of such exquisite jalees (lattices) are Hindu edifices. The Hindu royal emblem mounted on the upper part of the jalee disproves that the Mogul Shahjahan built the fort.” [1] Photos # 30 & 31: “The resplendent Hindu midday sun (from whom Hindu rulers claim descent) in the arch above flanked by the sacred Hindu letter OM. Below it is the royal Hindu insignia. This proves the hollowness of the claim that Shahjahan commissioned the Red Fort.” [1] [2] [3]Photo # 32: “It is entirely false that the Red Fort of Delhi was built by Shahjahan in 1639-48 A.D. Muslims were the destroyers of statues. Then why should they have constructed statues? But there are statues of Hindu Mahavants riding the elephants of the doors of each interior room of “Khas Mahal” in the Red Fort. On the main gate of the Fort named “Delhi Darwaja” there are huge statues of elephants. The curtain of building statues of elephants on forts and palace gates can be well judged by examining the palaces at Gwalior Udaipur and Kota. Decorating homes forts palaces and temples with elephants is a hoary Hindu tradition. To the Hindu an elephant symbolizes might power glory and wealth. The Red Fort in Delhi has life-size elephants at its gate and elephants with riders atop its door knobs in the Khas Mahal pavilion. Had Shahjahan built the fort such Hindu motifs should not have been there.” [3]Photo # 33: “A close up of the elephant and rider door knob in the Khas Mahal of the Red Fort in Delhi. This is a typically Hindu motif. Other big life-size stone elephants decorating the Naqqar Khana (Music House) gate were slaughtered by Islamic invaders. The chopped up pieces may still be seen stored in the Khas Mahal basements. The public must insist on these being joined and displayed.” [4]Photo # 34: “Inner view of the entrance to the so-called Moti Masjid inside Delhi’s Red Fort. The archaeological tablet outside claims that the mosque was built by Aurangzeb son and successor of Shahjahan. That claim is baseless because (1) The entrance is of a temple design. (2) The arch between the domes is made of banana bunches used in Hindu worship. (3) On either side above the arch are fruit trays. (4) Naming buildings after gems (Moti means pearl) is a Hindu custom. (5) If Shahjahan built the fort why didn’t he provide it with a mosque? (6) The truncated Hindu perambulatory passage may still be seen to exist on the building’s left flank. (7) The back of the wall shows signs of tampering.” [1] [3]Photo # 35: “A close-up of the interior top of the entrance arch of the so-called Moti Masjid (which was Hindu Moti Mandir) inside Delhi’s Red Fort. The arch at the bottom may be seen to be made of banana bunches. On either side above the arch are trays holding five fruits each as holy Hindu offering. Fruit is taboo inside Muslim mosques.” [1] [4]Photo # 36: “This temple-front design of ribbed gourd-like domes on either side with a pinnacle surmounted by a canopy in the centre embossed on the riverside wall of the Rang Mahal apartment inside Delhi’s Red fort is emphatic proof that the fort is a pre-Shahjahan Hindu fort. Even the name Rang Mahal is Hindu. In this same pavilion is carved on the floor an exquisite lotus in full bloom as a fountain trough. Muslim walls and floors are plain. The canopy in the photo may be seen at several Hindu altars. The kalash (pot) under it represents divinity in Hindu tradition.” [1]Photo # 37: ‘”Vishnu’s footprint’ in the so-called Humayun Tomb New Delhi. This photo is reproduced from page 78 of “The World of Ancient India” translated into English (from G. Le Bon’s original French book published in the 19th century) by David Macrae Tudor Publishing co. New York 1974. This photo proves that the so-called Humayun mausoleum is an ancient Hindu temple palace. Inquiries with archaeologists in Delhi drew a blank They have never seen these footprints which indicates that they are heir to a lot of non-information and mis-information. Humayun is not at all buried in Delhi. According to Farishta’s chronicle (English translation by John Briggs Vol. II page 174) Humayun is buried in Agra while according to Abul Fazal (Elliot & Dowson Vol. VI page 22) Humayun lies buried in Sirhind.” [1] [2]Photo # 38: “A panel of the so-called Kutab tower in Delhi. The exquisite serpentine Hindu pattern in the upper part is the wreath called ‘Makar Torana’ because it emanates from the mouth of a crocodile. This is a very common sacred Hindu motif in historic buildings. The Islamic tampering and forgery in stone may be seen in the lower portion. An attempt has been made to plant Koranic lettering. Such forgery in stone fooled even historians who thereby inadvertently ascribed those buildings to Muslim authorship.”[1]Photo # 39: “This remnant of a temple around the so-called Kutab Minar in Delhi has been named ‘Kuwat-ul-Islam’ mosque by the conqueror Kutubuddin in the closing years of the 12th century A.D. The term signifies “The Strength of Islam” in capturing and battering a Hindu temple and blatantly using it as a mosque. Ignorant historians who could not explain away the Hindu workmanship foolishly concluded that the Muslims demolished some other temple and carried the Hindu pillars hither to raise this ‘mosque (?).’ This is an absurdity from every point of view. Muslims only seized Hindu temples and pressed them into service as mosques.” [1] Photo # 40 & #41: “Muslim captors dismantled surface stones of the so-called Kutab tower in Delhi reversed them and inscribed Koran on the exterior. This Muslim forgery in stone came to light as those stones started falling off the tower. Here we can see the Hindu images on one side while the next view Photo # 41: reveals the subsequent Islamic lettering on the other.” [1]Photo # 42: “Four miles from the so-called Kutab Minar in Delhi is an ancient Hindu temple palace currently known as Sultan Ghari. An uncrowned son of sultan Iltmash (around 1230 A.D. ) is believed buried in it. That is a myth because there is no grave there. A Sanskrit inscription was also found in its ceiling. The beams of the octagonal crypt bore figures of Kamadhenu (celestial cow) and Varaha ([Lord Vishnu’s incarnation as a] wild boar). A Muslim tomb would never sport two highly detested animals. These two animals were a royal Hindu insignia. Even today five such pig-faced drain pipes may be seen projecting out of the walls of the royal pavilions inside Delhi’s Red Fort. Had Shahjahan built the fort as is currently believed he wouldn’t have had pigs peering from over his royal Islamic head since pigs are deeply detested by Islam. Contrarily the wild boar is an Hindu incarnation and sacred royal Hindu emblem. This is one of the visual proofs of the Hindu origin of Delhi’s Red Fort. So careless has been the study of Indian history that such graphic proofs have remained unnoticed. For similar more evidence read Mr. P. N. Oak’s research book titled “Delhi’s Red Fort is Hindu Lalkot.” [This photo was repeated elsewhere in the album under which was a caption that was completely different. You may want to read it as well which follows:]” [2] [3] [1] This ancient Hindu royal emblem of a wild boar (left) and the cow was found engraved on a lintel of what has been euphemistically called Sultan Ghari four miles from the Kutab Minar in Delhi. This proves that the so-called tomb was originally a Hindu palace. Like thousands of other buildings throughout India that palace too was pressed into Muslim use. Sultan Altmash’s son is believed to be buried there. Yet the tomb is not known after him but merely as the “Sultan’s Cavern.” Scholars have been wrong in believing that the building was built after the prince’s death. All such mediaeval tombs and mosques are erstwhile Hindu palaces and temples. That is why their decor is entirely Hindu. Historians and archaeologists hard put to explain away Hindu decor of what they believed to be Muslim buildings improvised the absurd justification that the building must have been fashioned out of the debris of some Hindu buildings or that the workmen being Hindu built in the Hindu style. Both these arguments are wrong. No building worth its name can be built out of debris. Similarly no workman ever dare or would ever care to fashion a building for which he is hired according to his own taste opposed to that of the owner’s. In this case the lintel was plastered over when the building was used as a Muslim tomb because the Islamic conscience cannot tolerate idolatrous images. Such tactics were used by Muslim invaders in all lands they overran when making use of captured buildings. A Sanskrit inscription was also found in the roof of the building. The building is octagonal in shape which is also a Hindu specialty. This royal Hindu emblem and another found in the Red Fort in Delhi stress the need for historians to look for and collect all such ancient Hindu royal emblems. This is a very enchanting and engrossing task that faces all those who are interested in rewriting Indian history after a millennium of Islam distortion and destruction.

Once the lord killed the demon still Narashima was in uncontrollable anger which even any other gods or asuras feared to go near to him. Even lord shiva tried to his ultimate power to control narashima but Bhaktha praglathan was not harmed instead blessed by Narashima. It was very clear that Bhaktha Pragalathan had done what other gods cant do.2. In hinduism there are plenty of asuras and devas tried to get boon to be im-mortal. Even great asuras like hirinyakashibu ravana was unable to get the boon even after performing years of thava. But our beloved bhakth Markendaya got the boon to be immortal from lord shiva. Markendaya got what no other powerful asuras tried to get.In hinduism Gods are not powerful because each God treats their bhakts more than them. Hinduism is such a beautiful religion. They will do anything for bhakths. According to me lord shiva respects workships Lord vishnu and vice versa. So lord shiva tries to make lord vishnu win and lord vishnu will try to make shiva win. Whoever wins the credit goes to opposite. So both of them will never loose if they had a fight.

You are asking this question as taught by Lord Macaulay. YOU can decide and know the reality in the following description. The new education policy of Lord Macaulay cut off the Indians from the Indian culture by dividing the converted and non-converted Indians into Hindu Religion and Muslim Religions Hindu was never a Religion of India the term Hindy Religion was coined by the British for divide and rule policy Lord Macaulay taught that the Vedas are religious scriptures of Hindu and ‘Aryan’ came from outside of India and killed Dravid black south Indians with the opium of religious superstition the discovery Grand Canyon an advanced Vedic Civilization in 1909 supported the Aryan invasion theory and we accepted it which is in the blood of Indians with mental slavery of Britain hence we have no pain for the so-called Religious bifurcation of India with less nationality it has pushed India in Religious fundamentalism. ‘JAMBU DWIP’ KNOWN TURTLE EYE LAND as Pangaea is the oldest where first humans came into the existence and later due to the shifting of the continents separated by different environmental conditions with different stages of mental evolution.Earth was one land mass For hundreds of millions of years all the land of Earth was joined together in one large mass or supercontinent. Scientists call it Pangaea (meaning “all lands” in Greek).d mass in India called ‘JAMBU DWIP’ or ‘Turtle Eye Land’ At the place of the Great Himalayan range there was a ‘Thesis sea’ Pangaea existed about 240 million years ago. By about 200 million years ago The collision of the Indian subcontinent and Asian continent created the Himalayan mountain range home to the world's highest mountain peaks plate tectonics which contributed to the creation of continents. The plate tectonics and Earth’s geomagnetism played a great role in the splitting of the continents a part. Pangaea existed about 240 million years ago. By about 200 million years ago this supercontinent began breaking up. Over millions of years Pangaea separated into pieces that moved away from one another. ) ..Tethys SeaAbout 225 million years ago India was a large island still situated off the Australian coast and a vast ocean (called Until 65 million years ago a great ocean the Tethys sea separated India from Asia. There were no Himalayas and no Tibetan Plateau. Continental Drift Theory Continental Drift Theory was put forward by the German scientist Alfred Wegner in 1915. According to the Continental Drift Theory The parts of the crust are capable of horizontal movement around the globe causing the continents to slowly change their positions in relation to one another with plate tectonics. The fact that South America is a mirror image of Africa is presented as proof of the continental drift theory (see the video below for an animation showing the migration of both of these continents). For hundreds of millions of years all the land of Earth was joined together in one large mass or supercontinent. Scientists call it Pangaea (meaning “all lands” in Greek). Then about 200 million years ago the land began to drift apart. It broke into two pieces and scientists have called the continent in the north Laurasia and the continent in the south Gondwanaland (named by Eduard Suess an Austrian geologist).The two large continents continued to break apart into the smaller continents that exist today. Scientists call this movement ‘continental drift.Forces responsible for the drifting of continents (According to Alfred Wegner) Indians kept a record of the beginning of the creation ‘jyotirlinga’ the beginning of the Time Era Yuga Introduction Ancient Indian History is not like the history written by western Historians and Archaeologists. They have kept records in Veda the oldest literary monument of human civilization on the earth. The creation is working as a system under the cycle of the year ‘Samvatsar Kal’ they have not mentioned their name date or year. We were unknown before birth and will be unknown after death. For whom we should write history. The rotation of the sun at its axis has given the concept of time as a great event MAHAKAL’ Jyotirlinga at Ujjain as one wheel chariot and the twelve ‘Jyotirlinga’ in India represents Twelve fellies Twelve ‘Aditya’ twelve faces of the sun with 360 days cycle of one ‘Samvatsar Kal’ under which the creation is working as a system under the cycle of six seasons. Twelve are the fellies and the wheel is single; three are the naves. What man hath understood it? Therein are set together spokes three hundred and sixty which in nowise can be loosened. Rig. 1-164-48 It has been indicated here that all the phenomena on the earth are going on under the wheel of the year. It has twelve months and three hundred and sixty days with three centers Sky the Atmosphere and the earth. It indicates the yearly cycle of the months and seasons. Under the wheel of the year nature exhibits its functions.Great Event Mahakal ‘jyotirlinga’ the beginning of the Time Era YugaKedareshwar Cave Temple is located at Harishchandragad a hill fort in the Ahmednagar district. The fort is a popular trekking location. Kedareshwar Cave Temple is much different from other temples. It is situated in a cave and also the presence of water all year round makes the temple one of the unique temples not just in Maharashtra but in India as well. A Shiva Linga ‘Jyotirlinga’ of about five feet is situated at the center of the cave. One has to wade through waist-deep and ice-cold water to reach the Shiva Linga. Though there were four pillars surrounding the Linga now there is only one pillar intact. Some believe the pillars to be symbols of yuga or time namely Satya Tretha Dwapara and the Kali Yuga. Great Event Mahakal ‘jyotirlinga’ the beginning of the Time Era Yuga Veda is the first word of a civilized person on Earth. The world is suffering from the superstition of modern development which is only halfway to touching the Vedic height of development. The modern development of science and technology has created a threat to the existence of life on the earth with global warming depletion of the ozone layer with the ‘Green House Effect’ and the threat of Nuclear war to destroy the present civilization. Vedas are not religious scriptures. Upnishads are not Veda Puranas were written to teach the original evolution of the creation in a symbolic anthropomorphic manner to preserve the Vedic knowledge with the personification of natural forces as demons and deities it has been turned into myths of mythology with a long history and fancy of the narrator. Without the full knowledge of the creation and life on the earth Vedic word symbols are like Black Buffalo’ no History No Religion nor a God is Black Era ‘Kali Yuga’ Yuga Era ( Sanskrit : युग) means \"a yoke \" (joining of two things) \"generations\" or \"a period of time\" Era such as age namely Satya Yuga Treta Yuga Dwapar Yuga and the Kali Yuga. Satya Yuga  signifies the era of the beginning of the creation all was pure no duality. Treta Yuga the evolution of the human species with three immortal and self-consciousness. Lord Ram represents immortal fundamental energy ‘Sita’ Sarasvati immortal phonon wave and Laxman immortal Electron. With the trinity of the three immortal the civilization evolved with the monkey brigade first and from the monkey the human species evolved with the conflict between the devils and demons as ‘SUR AND ASUR’ Dwapar Yuga the duality increased with the selfishness created conflict in the society. Lord Krishna has supreme fundamental energy enlightened to fight for right. Kali Yuga Black Era no ethics no God no Duty in life ignorant of the aim of life on the earth. It is a symbolic representation of the history of the creation and evolution of civilization on earth. With regards Dr. C.P.
